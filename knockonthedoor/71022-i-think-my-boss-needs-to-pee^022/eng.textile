A/N: The start of the most important Chapter both story wise, and in terms of omorashi content. Except for 3.1 and 3.3 Nearly every section will feature wetting over peeing, or a combo of the two. As stated above, feel free to add requests for scenes, which I am happy to do in the "interlude" sections. So long as I am comfortable with said scenario. The next update will be live 10/23/2021

Chapter 3.1: Jericho

Today was the day. The day before Mary-Ann would speak in front of ten thousand people; it would be her story, her accomplishments. Her triumph. She was proud, she was nervous, she was happy, she was scared. As she lay awake, just moments before her alarm rang, she almost didn’t believe this was happening. When prompted by her ringing alarm, Mary-Ann rose from her bed and turned on the lights. Stumbling around her packed suitcase, she made her way to the bathroom. It was a mess; Mary-Ann had been wetting nearly every evening over the past week. Her anticipation and nervousness would have ruined her sleep and weighed on her mind in the past, but now she would melt it all away after work. She’d hold and squirm all afternoon, only to come home, throw on an old outfit, hop in the shower, and go in her panties. The victims of last night’s escapade still hung from the shower door.

As Mary-Ann sat on the toilet for her morning pee, she wished she could have another wetting before her talk. But sharing a hotel room with Karenna would make it too awkward; not to mention socially unacceptable. Having a legitimate accident is one thing, doing so on purpose was quite another. Mary-Ann was thankful that Karenna had been so forgiving, but to ask her to forgive something so deliberate was to a bridge Mary-Ann wasn’t willing to cross. With an anxiety filled sigh, Mary-Ann released her bladder into the toilet.

It was a curious stream, Mary-Ann could hear it pouring out of her, but two separate rivulets had made their way to her butt cheeks. As she peed, they dripped off of her. It tickled a little. A clear pee, Mary-Ann’s holding did have the side-effect of nearly constant clear urine. Though she hadn’t woken up desperate, her morning stream was quite strong. Though certainly not as exciting as one of her planned wettings, she still appreciated the relief. Mary-Ann watched her pee stream start to end and could feel her bladder deflating back to its normal position. Empty, she started her shower and was ready for her flight towards the next chapter in her life.

The drive to the airport was uneventful, the early morning had little to no traffic except around the airport. Despite requiring an early wake up, Mary-Ann could take solace in the fact that she had beaten the sun up. She was going to meet Karenna at the entrance, and wondered if she would beat her young counterpart to the airport as well.

Mary-Ann was only partially right. Finding a place to park wasn’t difficult, but the walk to the “departures” entrance was much longer than she expected; especially when lugging a cumbersome suitcase, carry-on and her purse with her. By the time she got to the crosswalk, she was glad that she worked-out on a regular basis. She had pack a number of different outfits, for restaurant-wear, for beachwear, her outfit for her talk, casual-wear, she had an outfit or two for nearly everything she expected to do over the four day trip. Not to mention her make-up and toiletries. Looking around, she could see no sign of Karenna. The young women was typically prompt, and Mary-Ann was briefly concerned. She looked at the clock on her phone. She was early. Laughing at herself for forgetting the fact that she set her car clock fifteen minuets ahead to ensure that she’s always early, Mary-Ann sat on a bench and waited.

Karenna was used to early mornings. Not that it made them any easier, but she yawned as she exited her parked car. Grabbing her backpack out of the backseat, part of her questioned if she had brought enough for the four days. She assumed that traveling light would be the best and if it wasn’t for their planned trip to the beach, she certainly wouldn’t have packed her swimsuit. She was to tired to care at this point- she had stayed up too late packing, but dressing in red tracksuit pants and a sweater didn’t exactly make her feel ready to attack the day. She felt even less ready when she saw Mary-Ann waiting for her at the entrance; her boss looked sharp, with her blonde hair down and her casual jean skirt, which worked well with her striped shirt. The two gave each other a friendly hug and walked into airport.

The two ladies checked their bags and made light conversation through security. The lines were longer than one would think at such an early hour of the morning, but the security agents made short work of the mess of people. Karenna wasn’t a fan of the rigmarole that she was subjected to but it only took a few moments before she and Mary-Ann were through security and walking to their gate. With nearly an hour before their flight, the pair decided to get breakfast. While certainly not a classy meal, it would get the job done. Sitting down at the gate, Mary-Ann asked

“Have you ever flown before?”

“Once, when I was eight or so. If we went anywhere my grandpa would drive us usually.” Karenna sipped her orange juice

“I applied to be a stewardess. Thought it would be fun, you know? See the world, get paid for it and all, but they need their own schooling and I certainly didn’t have time for that in my early twenties.” Mary-Ann was just finishing her water as she finished her sentence.

“I think you did alright boss.” Karenna smiled without showing teeth

“Thanks. And I appreciate the respect but you don’t have to address me as boss. We’re basically equals. In fact, I might be putting someone under you. Sarah recommended her; said you met her. Her name’s Cassie.”

“She went to brunch with us a few weeks ago. Seems like she says the wrong things at the wrong time though, I don’t know if she could really be cut out for this.”

“I’ll keep that in mind.” Mary-Ann paused as Karenna finished her orange juice. She got up to throw it out Mary-Ann continued “Sarah also mentioned that she’d be here, she’s going to meet up with us after my talk and have dinner with us afterword’s.”

“So that’s why you brought me along, you didn’t want to have to spend a whole evening with her.

Mary-Ann smiled- amused at Karenna’s sense of humor “She’s not that bad. Just not as funny as you.”

“She’s just always been cold with me. The conversation felt like deadweight at brunch. I mean, she didn’t add anything.”

“It’s just the way she carries herself. Her family is very wealthy, she said something about descending from Persian aristocracy or oil money from somewhere over there.” Mary-Ann shrugged “Maybe you could loosen her up”

Karenna raised an eyebrow “What do you mean?”

Mary-Ann was taken aback. “What do you think I mean? Tell some jokes, a good story.” She paused again “You might want to grab some sleep on the plane.”

“I think you’re right.

“Speaking of which, we’re about to board soon” Mary-Ann stood up and the two walked towards the gate.

The two women talked off and on throughout boarding on the plane and taking their seats. An uneventful fight ensued, and neither of the two business women stayed awake. Mary-Ann awoke near the end of the flight, her mouth felt as though it was filed with cotton. She was lucky enough to catch the stewardess on her final round and grabbed a water for herself and an extra for the still sleeping Karenna. As she regained her wits about her, she couldn’t help but notice a slight fullness in her bladder, undoubtably filling from her breakfast. It wouldn’t be a long ride to the resort, and Mary-Ann was sure she could wait.

As the plane was landing, the stewardess was sure to wake up Karenna. In a bad mood from being awoken so unnecessarily she downed the water Mary-Ann had given her in silence. The pair departed the plane as soon as they were able too and Karenna tossed the empty water bottle into a trash can as the two made their way to baggage claim. As the two stood at the luggage carousel, Karenna started to feel her bladder.

“How long of a ride is it to the hotel?”

“Not more than fifteen minutes or so. I can ask the driver when we get to them though.”

“Driver?”

“Yeah, Warner’s people paid for airport transportation and everything. We’ll get our bags here and then find them, they should be holding a sign.”

The two were silent for a moment as they watched an assortment of bags start to trickle in. Karenna broke the silence first.

“I could use a shower or at least change into something more presentable when we get there.”

“I’m pretty hungry, but yeah, we’ll stop at the room, drop our things and you can change before we hit a restaurant. Plus it’ll be good to go up to the room first; I kinda have to pee.” Mary-Ann shifted her weight from one leg to the other as she said this.

Karenna was about to make a comment about Mary-Ann’s accident but thought better of it. With an acute pressure building in her own bladder, she was just happy to have an excuse to pee without being the one to bring it up. Still slightly groggy, Karenna brought up another concern.

“I really don’t want to have to walk anywhere though. Are you sure we can’t just order room service or something?”

Mary-Ann laughed as she grabbed her bag off of the carousel

“One day in and you’re already trying to spend my money?” Smiling she continued “We won’t have to walk that far. It’s a resort and casino, they’ve got more restaurants inside than we do in town. We’ll find a place”

Karenna nodded and finally saw her bag make it’s way down the carousel towards her. Taking her bag, the two walked outside. The first thing that Karenna noticed was the heat. While not debilitating, she had gotten used to the nice brisk air and the dry climate she was in now certainly didn’t recognize fall. Any temporary discomfort she felt was whisked away when she saw the sleek black luxury SUV and the handsome driver. He held a sign the read Adimari; Mary-Ann’s last name. He greeted the two women and took their bags. Traffic leaving the airport was slow, and Karenna fiddled with one of the complementary water bottles. She wasn’t terribly thirsty, but undoing the cap and taking a drink gave her something to do in the temporary silence. It must have taken ten or so minuets to reach the intersection at the airport entrance. Leaning forward Mary-Ann asked their driver

“How far out are we?”

“Oh, not too far.” He pointed to a large building towering over a downtown. “It’s that one right there. You wouldn’t think that a resort would have worked all the way out here, but I guess that’s why the family that owns it is worth a billion dollars.”

“Thanks, but how much longer until we’re there?” Mary-Ann looked at Karenna and smiled nervously, subtly putting one leg over the over.

“Shouldn’t be more than fifteen minutes. Traffic usually cooperates.”

Karenna shifted in her own seat. This was good news, while she could no longer completely ignore her filling bladder, fifteen minuets were more than bearable.

For Mary-Ann, her hold was still comfortable. The pressure against her privates produced a tingling sensation akin to a fine spice on the tongue. She stared out the window at the people on the sidewalk, part of her wondered if any of them would recognize her. With so little notice, was she even on any of the promotional material? They had asked for a headshot and her permission to use it but that didn’t mean that she would be on every billboard in town. Still, like everyone else in the world, she wondered what fame would be like. And what would they think of her secret? She looked over to Karenna and noticed the black woman’s hand suspiciously lording over her crotch.

“You feeling ok?”

Karenna turned away from the window

“Fine.” She looked a little confused “Why do you ask?”

“You seem quiet is all.”

“Just thinking.”

“Anything you want to share?”

“Yeah, when my friend Nia was in town, I had one chance to really reconnect with her. Show her how much I’ve made of myself. But, I introduced her to Sarah, and she brought along some trainee with a mouth. I think that was a mistake.”

Mary-Ann thought for a moment, legs still crossed, urine comfortably sitting in her bladder.

“Who else could you have introduced Nia to?”

“Well, you.”

“Wouldn’t that be redundant? You’re the expert in that conversation, what would I have added to the meeting?” Mary-Ann was hoping she could lead Karenna to an answer, rather than just tell her.

“I just think your personality would go along well with hers.”

Karenna wasn’t quite getting the lesson “But from a business perspective, you’re adding value by inviting someone else who can add to the conversation. She’s got plenty of experience- are you sure you don’t just have some personal animosity?”

Karenna wasn’t sure. “Maybe. Just something about her I guess.”

“You’ll get to liking her. We’ll see her tomorrow.”

The two were quiet for the rest of the short trip. Karenna was glad; while she wasn’t nearly as desperate as she had been with Nia, which she was sure to omit in her conversation with Mary-Ann, she was intent on getting to the bathroom first. Without an option to just let go like she did with Nia, Karenna knew she had to go badly enough that her bladder might just betray her.

The entrance to the hotel was just as grand as its stature among the other downtown buildings. An opulent building, it stretched miles into the air, unlike any hotel Karenna had ever seen. The carpark was filled with high end luxury cars and the cobbled roads gave the entire complex a feeling of decadence. The interior was just as grand, with a massive chandelier illuminating the many different paths. According to the signs on the walls, the farthest hall led to an open conference room, the one Mary-Ann would soon be speaking in. To her right, a massive open area that led to stores, restaurants and even a botanical garden.

To her left; a casino. It was the only way to get to the elevators and had a much lower ceiling that the rest of the opulent buildings. Karenna couldn’t even hear Mary-Ann checking-in over the sound of the machines, begging you to spend money on them. The space was much darker than the rest of the resort as well, the primary source of light was beaming from the screens of the many different betting games. It was a nice distraction for Karenna, she knew no one was pay attention to her thighs that were closed tightly. She did notice Mary-Ann had not uncrossed her legs behind the counter.

Mary-Ann was playing with herself. Not in the way she would have for the first 26 years of her life, that would be undignified. She was pressing the edge of the counter into her swelling bladder, enjoying the small jolts of pain and pleasure she received back. Had she been alone, she would have turned this day into a wetting, but as she turned back towards the elevators, she knew she couldn’t.

“Floor 32. Warner really put us up.” As Mary-Ann spoke, she couldn’t help but notice Karenna’s thighs no-so-subtlety clenched. No way she was holding intentionally, right?

“Restaurants that way, casino that way, bathrooms too if you need one.”

Karenna nodded and thanked Mary-Ann for the observations she had already made. When the two entered the elevator, they shared with a group of business professionals. A moment of awkward silence ensued. One of the men spoke up.

“Is your name Mary-Ann?”

She turned to look at the portly middle-aged man.

“Yes, that’s me.” She smiled pleasantly at him

“You’ve done a great job, I wish I knew at your age what you know. Looking forward to your talk.”

Mary-Ann thanked the man and turned back towards the elevator doors. It wasn’t a few more moments until the elevator reached their floor. Giving her goodbyes to the group, the pair of women exited the elevator into a large windowed hallway. The detail in the ceiling was just as impeccable. As Mary-Ann lead the way, Karenna spoke up

“Look at you, famous and all”

“I don’t feel like I’m ready for it.” Mary-Ann stopped at the door farthest down the hallway, just before it cornered with a windowless hallway. She waived the keycard in front of the heavy door.

“But even famous people need to pee.” Mary-Ann said as she stepped into the large open living area. Karenna followed

“Um…speaking of that, could I go first?”

“Oh, I won’t be that long. Sorry, been holding it since the we were on the plane.” Mary-Ann lifted her luggage onto one of the two beds.

Karenna grimaced as Mary-Ann locked the bathroom door behind her; it was adjacent to their bedroom. This wasn’t like her situation with Nia, where she could use the sound and sight of another woman pissing to her advantage. As she tossed her backpack onto the free bed, she held her crotch tight and prepared to battle with her bladder.

The first thing Mary-Ann noticed was the size of the bathroom. It was nearly as big as the one in her apartment. She admired the size of the shower and the free soap as she pulled down her panties. Her fun for the day over, she bid farewell to her slight desperation and watched a flow of urine leave her privates. Mary-Ann made a gentle moan as pleasure radiated from her emptying bladder. The wetness of her pee was gentle against her bare skin. As the toilet water met her water, it began to discolor, turning a light yellow. Continuing her release, Mary-Ann wondered anyone in that elevator had any idea that she had to pee. The thought excited her as her stream began to weaken.

The sound was unbearable. Karenna could hear her through the door. While the young professional had her hand jammed in and against her womanhood, she was unable to stop listening to her boss pee. Her desperation now beyond what she thought she could handle, and Karenna was worried. She knew this about herself, why didn’t she do something about it? Why couldn’t she wait like everyone else? What made her bladder want to release along with another girl’s? She cursed her sympathetic bladder. She could focus on unpacking. With her free hand, she grabbed a shirt and attempted to put it away.

As she turned to put it back in her side of the dresser, the movement caused her to inadvertently leak. She hated the fact that she could hear Mary-Ann peeing. She tossed the shirt into the dresser and removed her hand from her groin. She covered her ears to stop the torture. By removing her hands, she removed her protection. This time a longer spirt made its way out. She was out of time. Shoving both hands back into her crotch; the only logical thing she could think of, was to beg. Waddling to the door, she rapped on the door with her knuckles.

“Mary-Ann…could you please hurry…I…I’m…” She felt her panties warming. She was losing the battle

Mary-Ann heard her, the poor labored voice. She had no idea Karenna was that desperate. While not quite done herself, she wasn’t about to delay her agonized colleague. Mary-Ann squeezed her muscles tight, stopping her flow.

“Just a second.” Mary-Ann stood up and cleaned herself quickly, using only one square

Out of a force of habit, she unlocked the door. Karenna nearly took her arm off as she flung the door open. As Mary-Ann prepared to wash her hands, Karenna whipped down her track pants and started the most forceful pee Mary-Ann had ever witnessed outside of her own.

The relief of making it and the satisfaction of her easing muscles forced Karenna to moan. Out loud, over her hissing slit she noted

“Oh man…I had to piss so bad!” Her closed eyes and ample spray confirmed it

“I’m sorry.” Mary-Ann turned off the tap “I had no idea it was that bad.”

Karenna leaned back, the jet of desperately held pee overlapping with Mary-Ann’s. She didn’t pee nearly as long as Mary-Ann did, and as her boss gingerly and apologetically walked out of the bathroom, she was starting to finish. She exhaled deeply. Karenna had thought for a moment that she wasn’t going to make it. As her forceful stream started to trickle and drip, she surveyed the damage. Her pants were still dry from what she could see, but her purple panties were dark in the crotch. How could she hide this from Mary-Ann? As she debated with herself she felt another urge as she always did and released another few seconds of pee into the well-filled toilet bowl. Now finished, she wadded up her toilet paper and flushed. Thinking quickly she dropped her pants and panties. Tossing the soiled underwear into a corner, she pulled her pants back up. Mary-Ann was observing the living area. Karenna spoke first.

“Thanks boss. I was worried there for a second.”

“I told you, you shouldn’t have to call me that anymore.”

“Yeah.” Karenna shrugged. “But it’s your nickname now, whether you want it or not.”

Looking away, Mary-Ann smiled. Nicknames were for friends.

A/N: This has to be my Magnum opus. A long scene, it not only includes 3 peeing scenes, but 2 wetting scenes as well. If you are not into humiliation or beration, the ending could be a little off putting. But I assure you it is not only important story-wise, it doesn't last long. Plus it was fun to write. I know this came late but I was not expecting this part of the story to take so long. Next update will be either 10/26/2021 or 10/27/2021 depending on IRL work schedule. Others have also gotten their requests in for special scenes/scenarios during the interlude, so if you have an idea, be sure to let me know!

Chapter 3.2: The First Day of the Rest of Their Lives

Karenna awoke to the sound of an unlocking door. The room was dark, and for a moment, she didn’t remember where she was. Red light pierced the dark room; she looked at the alarm clock. It was around 9 o’clock in the morning. In a rush, Karenna rolled out of the spacious bed and flung open the heavy curtains. The natural light nearly blinded her and the heat from the intense sun was immediately present on the expansive windows. Mary-Ann was already up, her bed an unkempt mess; one that was clearly slept in. Yawning, Karenna grabbed the same red track pants she had worn on the plane- she wasn’t about to greet her boss in panties.

Mary-Ann was reading at the moderately sized table in the center of the living area. The large windows gave plenty of light and the morning sun bounced off of the small balcony. As the door to their bedroom opened, Mary-Ann took a break from reading.

“Jet-lag get to you?”

“The what?”

“Whenever you fly long distances, it can get you. Makes me sleep way to long.”

Karenna nodded, still half asleep. She yawned again. Mary-Ann spoke again

“I’m just glad you didn’t sleep too long. Can’t go this whole trip without working.”

Karenna blinked in an attempt to adjust to the light “Just don’t expect a full day out of me. Is there any coffee in here?”

“Not from what I could tell. But there’s a chain on the other side of the casino. If you’re going to get it, I’d go for it now. It made me have to pee like a racehorse this morning, and I doubt the venue’s going to have readily available bathrooms.” Mary-Ann of course was omitting the fact that she had held her morning pee until after she had gotten her coffee to the room and finished it.

“They don’t have bathroom’s in the conference hall?” Karenna was worried

“No, I’m sure they do. But a thousand or more people in one space is hard to plan for. I’m sure there’ll be a wait.”

Karenna nodded, unsure of how to add to the conversation. Mary-Ann thought of a funny anecdote.

“I’m actually surprised you didn’t wake up when I rushed in there. I was all ready to apologize when I came out and you didn’t even budge.” Mary-Ann smiled, anticipating a laugh from Karenna. It disappeared when the latter nodded again.

Karenna was unsure how to respond, more to herself than to Mary-Ann. The thought of her boss being so desperate again. The image of Mary-Ann’s wet pantyhose those few months ago weaseled its way into her minds eye. She could see the dark wet patch on her boss’s skirt again. The way her piss had turned one of her legs nearly-see through; while just smaller patches ran down her other leg. She felt the way she felt that day. Strange. Karenna wasn’t sure what she felt but it wasn’t disgust or even a humorous memory. It was different than all the rest. In the absence of knowing her own emotions she chose to run. Run away from this topic. She changed the subject, she pointed to Mary-Ann’s book.

“What are you reading? Looks interesting.” Karenna didn’t mind reading, but she wanted her mind off of what ever emotions she could feel.

“It’s a book on psychology. It is interesting, but a little dry.”

“Shouldn’t you be prepping for your talk?” Karenna still couldn’t get her mind to forget about Mary-Ann’s mishap

“It’s more of an interview-style talk. I think he’ll just through me some softballs. I’m more worried about the amount of people that’ll be watching me than the questions he’ll be asking.”

“You’ll do fine boss. You have a way with words.”

Mary-Ann smiled without taking her eyes off of her book.

“You know, I doubt I’d be here without your support.” She turned her head towards Karenna “I’d say you were a pretty good first hire.”

Karenna thanked her, and Mary-Ann reminded her that she needed to get ready soon so that she could get into her professional clothes for her talk. Despite the friendly banter, Karenna certainly didn’t want to make her late, nor did she like being late herself. Even on vacation. Showering was a good idea, especially because it gave Karenna a chance to relieve herself of her morning pee.

Karenna walked back into their room and grabbed her clothes for the day from her backpack. A pair of light grey panties were going to be hidden beneath her tight kaki pants. They were her favorite dress pants. Not only did they hug her legs tightly, but the back pockets gave them an edge over most women’s clothing. She topped off the outfit with a white blouse and a navy blue sport coat. Grabbing the entire concoction, Karenna made her way into the bathroom and shut the door behind her. Her pants were soon draped around her ankles and she sat her bare bottom down on the porcelain.

While she wasn’t desperate by any means, it didn’t take much for her to start peeing. A short yellow stream sprung out from her womanhood, saturating her dark skin and yellowing the water below her. The only sound that she could hear was the splashing of the bowl below her. As she felt it begin to end, her stream instead broke into a second weaker dribble that tickled her more sensitive skin. Eventually her yellow pee subsided and Karenna got up to turn on the shower. Sliding out of her shirt she was now fully nude as she sat back down on the toilet. She always had an extra second or two of piss that she needed to expel after her initial release. Sometimes it was immediate, and sometimes she had to wait for an extra moment. As the room warmed from the heat of the shower, Karenna started to warm her genitals with her second stream. It wasn’t more than a quick splash into the bowl and a number of drops that escaped her.

The shower water was warm as she shut the door behind her. It drowned out the flushing of the toilet. As Karenna washed her pussy with the running water, she wondered about her second stream that always followed her first. She thought about her sympathetic bladder, how she could stand the sound of another woman peeing. However, these thoughts didn’t last long, against her wishes her mind wandered back to Mary-Ann. Maybe her boss had those same problems. Karenna pushed the thought away. It came back. She tried to distract herself by lathering her body in soap. No luck.

She remembered cleaning her boss’s rug. Her mind went back to those same thoughts. What would it feel like to piss herself? More importantly, what did it look like while Mary-Ann was peeing her pantyhose. Absent mindedly, Karenna was sensually playing with her breast. What if the roles were reversed? She imagined Mary-Ann yelling at her, berating her, then comforting her. She was aroused, her soft genitals now moist with lust. She stopped. Those thoughts, her boss. It was too dirty. Mary-Ann would never know how much she meant to Karenna; how badly the young woman wanted to be like her. Karenna shouldn’t think of her that way.

Mary-Ann was trying to focus on reading. While she hadn’t had all that much to drink since this morning’s hold, she was keeping in whatever hadn’t been released in her desperate morning rush. While it was still just as comfortable as any of her other holds the running water wasn’t helping. Mary-Ann looked at her watch. It was quarter after 10. Karenna had been in there for an hour, surely she’d be done soon. So Mary-Ann sat for a little while longer, her hand occasionally protecting her crotch. She was comfortably holding her pee.

By the time Karenna had cut the water off it was just over half past 10. Another fifteen minuets had passed and not only was Mary-Ann hoping that she could find a moment to relieve the pressure she felt, but it was nearly time for her to show up backstage. She put the book down on the table, no longer interested in reading. Preening her white dress pants she exhaled into a growing anxiety. Public speaking, little preparation, and a growing desperation were a terrible combination that was brewing for Mary-Ann. She stood up and began to pace. Partly to distract herself from her desperation and partly to ease her growing anxiety. She checked her watch again. She had to be backstage in just ten minutes. If she didn’t say something now, she knew she would regret it. Walking back into their room she turned and knocked on the bathroom door.

“Hey, I’ve got to leave in 10. Any chance I could get in there soon?”

Karenna unlocked the door and pushed it a bit to open it. She was dressed and finishing her makeup.

“I’m going to be a bit longer than 10. Are you comfortable if I look the other way boss?” Karenna had her own motivations

Mary-Ann thought for a moment. She would either have to get herself back stage, prepped with a microphone and hope that she could find a way to relieve herself or she could get over any temporary embarrassment and relive herself near Karenna. She was reassured by the thought that it couldn’t be any worse than what Karenna had already seen. Mary-Ann opened the door the rest of the way.

In front of the toilet she pulled at her zipper. Nothing. She tugged again. Nothing. She grabbed it with her fingers and pulled again. Nothing still. The strain of pulling on her zipper caused her to grunt and her exertions were obvious.

“Karenna.” She paused, it was a little awkward “My zipper’s stuck. Could you help?”

Karenna was still adjusting her makeup when she stopped. “Uhm...yeah. Sure”

Mary-Ann tried to lighten to situation. She said warmly “Not in the job description, I know.”

Karenna turned and bent forward, grabbing at her boss’s zipper. She felt those feelings again. Cringing at herself internally she jimmied her boss’s zipper. As she played with the jammed fastener, she couldn’t help but brush up against Mary-Ann’s lady parts. Just a graze or a sweep- she was just working the zipper, after all. Pressing against the teeth of the zipper she finally tugged the fastener free. She wasn’t sure what caused the issue.

Mary-Ann thanked her as she pulled down her pants. She had pink panties on, and Karenna could see that she shaved. Before Mary-Ann pulled them down she asked

“Could I have a little privacy please? I don’t mind if you need to finish your make-up, but it’d help if you didn’t stare.”

“Right. Sorry.” Karenna had gotten lost in thought. Mary-Ann was going to pee in front of her, unknowingly playing into Karenna’s shower fantasy. The black woman would have to be cool. Once Mary-Ann started, she was afraid of getting wet in another way. Thinking quickly, she started the hair dryer. She was going to have to do so anyway.

As the noise of the hairdryer reverberated off of the bathroom walls, Mary-Ann released the hold on her second pee of the day. She couldn’t hear her urine leave her body, but as she felt the pressure from her bladder exercise itself, she couldn’t help but enjoy the feeling. Not wanting to look at Karenna anyway, she looked downwards, observing her stream. It was strong and clear, her reward for leading a healthy lifestyle. As her bladder deflated, she looked at her watch. She still had time to make it backstage, a benefit of having the venue inside the hotel. As she finished up, she contracted her muscles again to make sure she was empty, and briefly renewed her strong stream. It only lasted a few seconds before dying back down. The same powerful force that had expelled the rest of her morning coffee and water was now just a trickle. Refreshed, Mary-Ann dried herself with a square of toilet paper and flushed. Standing, she pulled her panties and pants back over herself.

“Sorry it had to be that awkward Karenna. But thanks for helping me with this zipper.” She gestured towards her pants. “Truth be told, I’d rather not have had to run to a production assistant or something.”

Karenna could hardly hear her over the hair dryer but let Mary-Ann know it wasn’t a big deal. She suppressed her actual thoughts on the subject. More for her sake than Mary-Ann’s. Continuing the one-way conversation Mary-Ann said

“I’ve got to go down and get ready. You’ve got about two hours before I’m on stage, do you need anything before I go?”

Karenna shook her head, and wished Mary-Ann good luck. Her boss made her way out of the room while Karenna turned off the hair dryer to let her hair dry the rest of the way naturally and started to finish her make-up. After applying a touch of her light red lipstick, she was ready to finally eat. One of the hotel restaurants would do just fine.

It was a pain to manipulate her way through the crowds. Shoving through people entering and exiting through the same four grand door was indicative of the crowded venue. The auditorium was as opulent as the rest of the resort, and the massive room surrounded the stage with seating on nearly every side. Mary-Ann couldn’t help but notice that there was just two wash closets on either side of the room with the lines stretching at least twenty people deep. She couldn’t help but feel a sense of satisfaction that she had made the right choice in going before she got here. Stepping down the staired aisleway she gave her credentials to the security guard at the bottom of the amphitheater seats.

Karenna found the entire place a bizarre maze of people. Like shopping on black Friday, it was as if every family or group at the resort had decided to eat or attend the event at the same time. She checked her phone. She still had about an hour before she needed to be there. Maneuvering her way towards the complex of restaurants wasn’t easy. She had to moving in the same direction as the pool area, and the wide hallways were slow moving. After passing the doors to access the pool, she made her way to a large circular area that housed nearly any eatery that one could desire. Large enough to require two floors, the entire area felt like it was heated by the glass ceiling that let the nearly-afternoon sun bare down on it. The center fountain and faux-fauna gave the entire space an air of sophistication that was missing from the casino side. Karenna chose a bistro that seemed a little less crowded that the rest of the restaurants. She was told her wait wouldn’t be that long.

The workers backstage were very friendly to Mary-Ann. The microphone fit snuggly on her grey pinstripe blouse. Unless you were looking for it, you wouldn’t be able to see it. She was nearly alone in the makeshift common area. A few production assistants, security guards and showrunners were scattered about. Others were more interested in the food table. A Surprisingly enough she heard a new voice greet her by name.

“Mary-Ann, your reputation proceeds you. So glad you could make it.” Steven Warner extended his hand.

“Well, when someone asks you to come speak at an event like this, you don’t turn them down. And I wasn’t about to show up late.” Mary-Ann was hoping that cam off as a complement.

Warner smiled like a used car salesman. Now off stage, his Kentucky drawl was much more pronounced. He asked her if she had tried any of the food, motioning to the tables. Having just gotten finished setting up, Mary-Ann told him that she had not. He continued

“Feel free to pick at anything you like. Champagne is there if you need to calm your nerves of celebrate a job well done. Your plus one, or family is also welcome back here.”

“I’m not so sure Champagne

- is for calming the nerves.” Mary-Ann gave a perplexed look. “But thanks, I’ll bring some people down beforehand.”

“I’m more game for bourbon myself, but nonetheless, I know this can be stressful. I have all the confidence in you that you’ll be fine.” He pointed to his forehead “But the mind is a fickle and funny thing Ms. Adimari.” He pointed towards her “Don’t let it trick you now.”

“I know who I am. I know I deserve to be here Mr. Warner.” She was trying to sound confident, but instead sounded incensed.

Warner spoke to her gently “If I didn’t think you were ready I wouldn’t have invited you. We have quite a few young people in the audience today, and I just know their going to be inspired by you. You’re an inspiring person Mary-Ann.”

Mary-Ann nodded and smiled. For someone who dressed like a car salesmen and spoke like a southern politician, he certainly knew how to make you feel important. Before she could say a word he continued

“Now, when we get out there, I like to present things as friendly. I intend to give you a professional hug, but I don’t want you thinking I’m being fresh now. Is that alright with you?”

“Sure. You didn’t need to ask- I trust you.”

“I don’t need to, but I want to. I would hope my daughters would get the same treatment.”

Mary-Ann couldn’t help but appreciate the gentleman. He excused himself to get back on stage. As he was leaving, Mary-Ann received a text from Sarah. The two chatted about Mary-Ann’s newfound respect for Warner and decided that Sarah was going to meet her backstage just before Mary-Ann went on. Grabbing a water bottle from the table Mary-Ann tried to mentally prepare herself.

“Would you care for another orange juice miss?”

“No, thanks, a water will do just fine.” Karenna finally felt normal again and was enjoying the time to herself. Though eating outside the restaurant in a railed off area almost made her feel like she was in a food court, the fake plants provided some shelter from the main foot traffic. Her breakfast was one of the best meals she may have ever had. Everything had been prepared just the way she liked it, and once she added a dash of extra salt it had every flavor she wanted. Though it had made her thirsty, and the cute water was bringing her second water over. Aside from finishing her orange juice, Karenna still felt like she needed an extra kick. She had passed a small coffee kiosk on the way to the rotunda, and planned to make a visit after breakfast.

With just fifteen minutes to go before she got on stage, Mary-Ann wondered where Sarah and Karenna were or if the two had even met up. She sent a group text to both of them. Karenna was the first to respond

In a line just out front. Be there soon.

Mary-Ann understood what she meant and after finishing another bottle of water she hoped her bladder wouldn’t give her any trouble. She wasn’t even that thirsty, but it was something to occupy her mind. Her phone pinged her with another text. Sarah this time

Just coming to the doors now, I’ll meet Karenna first and head your way.

Mary-Ann started to pace backstage. There wasn’t much to think about now.

Karenna’s hand was getting cold. Her iced coffee was a well-received pick-me-up, but her 2 glasses of water and a glass of orange juice were starting to work on her bladder. While not desperate by any means. Karenna was not about to suffer during Mary-Ann’s talk. The line was long though, Karenna was hoping to meet Mary-Ann before she went on stage, but that was becoming less and less likely as the movement was slow. As she drank from her plastic coffee cup she felt a presence behind her. Turning around, she saw Sarah, extending her hand to shake Karenna’s. As the two shook hands, Karenna met her almond eyes, staring back at them with her own. Sarah’s styled, shoulder-length black hair looked nearly perfect. It was quite the accent to her tight blue dress which showed her massive D-cup breasts. Sarah spoke directly, hardly showing her perfect teeth.

“Mary-Ann sent us both a text, did you get it?”

“Yeah, I just needed a break first.”

“That can wait, neither of us want to be laggards. C’mon” Without waiting for Karenna’s response she started to walk towards the entrance, expecting Mary-Ann’s understudy to follow. Taking one last glance at the line, Karenna obliged.

Sarah outpaced her the entire way though the crowd. With people starting to take their seats, Karenna had to maneuver her way towards the stairs in the furthest isle. It wasn’t until they reached the security guard at the lowest level that she was able to catch up.

“We’re with Mary-Ann.”

“Sorry, can’t let you through on that.”

Karenna felt annoyed. She wasn’t even going to be let through, nor could she now get back in line before the start of Mary-Ann’s talk.

“It’s alright, they’re with me.”

She heard Mary-Ann call to the security guard as she was walking over to them, obviously in a time crunch. When the security guard let them through, Mary-Ann gave Sarah a quick platonic hug. She smiled at Karenna. Sarah congratulated Mary-Ann on her accomplishment and the trio walked back stage. Mary-Ann introduced them to some of the people working the technical pieces and equipment. They were all busy, but Mary-Ann had made friends fast. Showing her tendencies as a lawyer, Sarah eyed the Champagne and hurried over to the pre-filled glasses. Mary-Ann turned to Karenna

“See, she’s not so bad. Did you two have a chance to chat?”

“Yeah for about 2 seconds. All she did was drag me away from the bathroom.” Karenna finished her iced coffee

“It’s not like we had a ton of time, you’ll warm up to her, I promise.”

Sarah returned with three glass, each bubbling in a celebratory manner. She handed one to Mary-Ann and Karenna. Raising her own glass in a small toast she proclaimed

“Here’s to the first day of the rest of your life Mary-Ann. May we all grow to enjoy it.”

Karenna nearly threw up as the carbonation ran down her throat. Not only was the drink bitter, but the lack of sugar that came with most wines was off putting. She stomached it for the rest of the group though.

“Why is that stuff used for toasts? It has to be the worst thing ever.” Mary-Ann’s face showed her displeasure.

Sarah seemed unfazed “There’s nothing wrong with tradition.” She put her hand on Mary-Ann shoulder

“Now go out there and show the world who you are.”

Mary-Ann smiled as Sarah and Karenna left to take their seats. She ascended the stairs behind the stage backdrop. Eying the program director, she waited for a cue from the older woman. As the butterflies in her stomach fluttered about, time seemed to stand still. She stood, hearing the muffled voices and booming microphones. Warner was starting his introduction. A story, fictionalized or not it was a nice anecdote to describe Mary-Ann’s career. The program director looked over. Mary-Ann nodded. Fear, stress, anxiety; all of those distractions had to be put away now. It was showtime. As her name was broadcast over the microphones, she stepped out on stage. A blaze of colors and hype music followed her. Warner gave her his hug. All of her worry was at the back of her mind. She chose to attack the situation. Sitting down however, she felt like her bladder was going to make its presence known. The water and Champagne mix was an unpleasant one. Lucky, she had an audience to talk to.

The first twenty minutes or so went by quickly. The energy that was broadcast through the music and lights made Mary-Ann’s entrance and her opening answers that much more engaging. Karenna knew her well, but Mary-Ann’s early life was fascinating. It was like watching an idol, she seemed larger than life. But time also reminded her that her last visit to the bathroom was over two hours ago, and while that wouldn’t have been a problem if she had been drinking normally, the drinks she had downed had been processed. Her bladder was reminding her that at this point in its fullness, she normally would have voided it at this point. But this wasn’t a normal day. Karenna shifted in her seat, hoping her boss was having a better time.

Until now Mary-Ann had been enjoying herself. She spoke in platitudes about hard work and related them to her life story. While the questions were not difficult, they had been introspective. She could feel the audience hanging on her words. But Mary-Ann knew that none of them were aware that she had to pee. Not Warner, not those who were backstage, not even her colleagues. The pure naughtiness of it nearly made her wet for another reason. She was smart, composed, and invigorating on the outside. But inside she could feel her bladder kicking against her muscles. Though these thoughts were usually enough for her to sustain a long hold, the champagne had not been so kind. Rather than just the water pressing on her abdomen, Mary-Ann could start to feel pain at the sides of the same area. Normally this was her cue to either find a bathroom or wet herself, whichever she had in mind. But as she discreetly folded one leg over the other in her chair, she had neither in mind.

“About how long has it been?” Karenna leaned over and whispered to Sarah.

“A little rude, aren’t you?” Sarah’s face proved her indignation

“No, its not that.” Karenna wasn’t about to tell her how bad she had to piss. Even if it was Sarah’s fault. “I…I’m just uncomfortable in these chairs. Bad knee” She lied

“You’re too young for that. Here; rub your knuckles against your back. Right here.” Sarah demonstrated the motion

Karenna followed the motion, but as she pressed into her back it was as thought she had pushed her water forward. She cringed and shot her body forward. Rubbing her thighs together in an odd attempt to repel her advancing urine. Having not gotten an answer from Sarah, she checked her phone. The hour was just past halfway. Karenna clenched her thighs together and pressed her womanhood into the edge of the seat. As she was putting her phone into her back pocket, Sarah scolded

“Put that away. At least pretend you’re paying attention.”

Karenna could only mumble an apology. Fear now gripped the young black woman.

As Mary-Ann finished her answer to a question, she couldn’t help but shift and cross her legs in another way. She felt bloated; heavy even, and she had no idea how long she had been talking. She felt as though her energy had dropped, as she was now focused almost entirely on holding back her floodwaters. Part of her wondered if she would be as desperate if she could use her hands to hold herself, but there was no way she was about to do that in front of one thousand or more people. As she prayed that her pelvic exercises would save her, she squeezed and contracted her walls in hopes that they could do the trick. She was sure her tight pants were showing off these contractions. But she was confident they were hidden.

“…Do you have any thoughts on that.” Warner was trying to lead her in a response to a question she hadn’t been paying attention to.

Mary-Ann took a sip from her water and pretended to be contemplative.

“You know Steven. That’s a great question. This is what I call a teachable moment in my office. You don’t always have to answer right away. Do you remember the old sales trick, ‘sell me this pen’?”

Steven nodded

“That exercise is about the question, not the answer, isn’t it?”

“And this is how you built your real estate portfolio over the past three years?”

“Everything is a sale, I don’t care what it is. You always have to sell, how do you do that, and how well you do that will determine your success. You ask questions.” She paused for effect. “The wisest person always asks the most questions, isn’t that right?” As she motioned to the crowd, and uproar and applause rocked the room.

“Did you write that down?” Sarah whispered over to Karenna

Karenna was too busy shoving both hands into her crotch and rocking back and forth into her seat to have heard what Mary-Ann said. She half mumbled a reply. Having lost track of time, Karenna’s mind could only concentrate on one thing and that was not releasing her pee. Of all the times she had been desperate in her life, she couldn’t think of one that was worse. It hurt. Don’t pee. Don’t pee. Don’t pee. Don’t pee. I really have to pee. The same two phrases dominated Karenna’s mind. Desperately, she checked her phone for the time. It should almost be over. She waited; trying to be the good understudy that she was. Trying to do what Sarah wanted. She stayed seated for another moment. Was it two minutes? One? Five? She didn’t know anymore. She couldn’t take it. Legs still crossed, she gingerly stood up. Sarah grabbed her wrist.

“What do you think you’re doing? You think Mary-Ann would walk out on you like that?”

Karenna wasn’t going to hide it any more. She stood pretzel legged, both hands hugged her crotch. She spoke in a labored voice, the strain was great.

“Please. I. Have. To. Pee. So bad right now. It won’t be too-“ Sarah cut her off. Her tone aggressive and annoyed

“You don’t think I’m in the same boat? Start acting like the woman of stature that you are. Sit down and hold it.”

“I…I don’t think I can sit. I…I might lose…it.” Karenna could feel the heat rush into her face. Admitting her need was bad enough. Admitting she was about to piss her pants was even worse.

“Look, I don’t ca-“ Sarah was cut off by cheers and applause. A recorded voice boomed over the load speaker announcing Mary-Ann’s name again and asking for another applause for her. The crowd was more than happy to whistle and express their emotions. Sarah stood, still holding Karenna by the wrist, as she walked the two of them up the aisle.

As Mary-Ann hustled backstage, she stole a moment to hold herself. She continued to move down the steps and towards the back of the stage, her hand holding her lady parts. Hoping no one would be paying attention to her, her hopes were dashed when the same production assistant that had signaled for her to go on stage called to her.

“Hey Mary-Ann, we’re going to need that mic!”

Mary-Ann had forgotten her lapel. Thankfully she hadn’t said anything off-color or the entire crowd would know. As the assistant caught up with her, the other woman switched off Mary-Ann’s microphone, hitting Mary-Ann with her ponytail in the process. The woman was moving fast. Jokingly she said

“You’re not trying to steal from us, are you now?”

Nervously she chuckled at the bad joke. She asked a more pertinent question

“Is there like a private bathroom we can use back here?”

“No. Trust me I wish. Try going the whole day without one- I don’t have any time for it myself.”

Clearly happy to have someone to sympathize with, the other woman started to show more signs of desperation. As she unclipped Mary-Ann’s pack from her pocket, she crossed her legs and bounced a little.

“I’m sorry, I thought they would at least have a porta-potty or something.” Now more comfortable with being open with this women, Mary-Ann clutched herself again.

“This resort has zero bathrooms.” Before walking off she added “I might have to piss into my heels.” She pointed towards a side door “Oh, and stars go through there so they don’t get mobbed. Especially if you’re needed to get back to your room.”

The point was vague, and as Mary-Ann surveyed the backstage area, she tapped her own heel in desperation. The seats were propped up by a cement wall. It only stretched out in a half circle, so when Mary-Ann did finally spot the door on the side of the seating support, she couldn’t wait to run over to it. Instantly recognizing her, the guard unlocked the door for her. It was clearly a service area. But it was only dimly lit. Mary-Ann was seriously considering squatting on the floor when she heard a voice.

“Excuse me miss? The exits up here.” A security guard in plain view stood at the top of an incline.

Happy to have decided not to drop her pants and squat right in front of this man, Mary-Ann walked up the short incline.

“Where you headed?”

“Back to my room, trying not to get mobbed by a thousand people.” And I really have to pee! She thought to herself

“Warner’s people go this way.” He pointed towards a series of brightly lit hallways. Thanking the man, Mary-Ann dashed off down the halls.

They were not nearly as opulent as the rest of the resort, but they clearly served a purpose. Sound equipment, sound engineers, and camera operators were all huddled in different rooms. Making sure there machine were running at peak efficiency. Removing her hand from her crotch and attempting to look dignified, Mary-Ann asked

“Where’s the exit?”

“Straight ahead, you can’t miss it Brings you out near the food court.”

As she thanked the man, she thanked her luck. Outside the venue seating was sure to have a bathroom with a shorter line.

It didn’t take her long to reach the exit. She opened the door without many people noticing or caring who she was. At the moment, Mary-Ann didn’t care either. Now was her chance to relieve herself and then find Sarah and Karenna. It wasn’t a moment after she finished the thought that she got a call from Sarah. She had to pick it up.

“Hey, where are you?”

“Just outside the doors, I was about to head up the room before I got noticed.” She lied

“Hang on, we’ll come to you.”

Karenna couldn’t stand up straight. At least Sarah had released her wrist as soon as the had gotten into crowd, but Karenna’s slowing movement held the two back. Keeping her eyes focused on the blue dress that Sarah was waiting help Karenna, in a hunched over state, to wade her way through the throngs of people. She wasn’t even sure where they were going. Out the doors. Progress. Karenna saw the bathroom lines, she had to make it back the room, there was no chance she could last in one of those lines. Spotting Sarah’s blue dress again, she tried to stand up as straight as her swollen abdomen would allow. Her bladder felt like a rock. Sarah was walking towards a small crowd of people, and Karenna was walking as fast as she could to catch up.

As Mary-Ann was trying to shake hands and thank the small number of people that had begun to surround her, she saw Sarah in her blue dress walking towards her. The lawyer pushed her way through the crowd, drawing eyes from some of the men. Mary-Ann hadn’t spotted Karenna. Sarah gave her a quick hug and started to dissipate the crowd. Her legs still bouncing in an effort to keep her urine in, Mary-Ann asked

“Where’s Karenna? Wasn’t she with you? She was just a moment ago. She may have ducked o- there she is.” Sarah pointed to a limping black women in khakis. Worried for her protégé, Mary-Ann sped-walked up to her.

“Hey, Karenna, you don’t look so great, are you ok?”

She looked up at Mary-Ann, her eyes wide. Nearly pleading with her boss. She stopped near Mary-Ann and instantly shot her hands into her crotch. Mary-Ann knew what was wrong.

“I have to. Piss. Really badly.” Karenna’s voice labored over every word.

To both Mary-Ann and Karenna’s surprise, Mary-Ann put her own situation bluntly “Me too. Let’s get upstairs, and fast.”

Sarah made a face, though Karenna couldn’t make out whether or not she was upset at the crude language or the fact that Karenna was unabashedly holding herself in the middle of a resort. Karenna didn’t care. So long as she could walk, she was confident she would make it. As the trio approached the elevators, that confidence began to wane. Every step had begun to send pain down her entire spine. Karenna could only feel agony in her desire to hold it. As the three waited for the elevators, there wasn’t much Karenna could do to ease the worst pain she had felt in recent memory.

However, she felt as though one wrong move would be the most embarrassing mistake of her life. They didn’t have wait long for the elevator, but in that time all she could do was pretzel her legs and lower her body into a quasi-squat. It hurt. It hurt badly. The ding of the elevator was a call from an Angel. What luck she had today- it was one just for them. Sarah first, then Mary-Ann walked into the opulent space. Karenna hobbled her way through. As the door closed Sarah spoke

“You two were quite the spectacle.”

Karenna hurt too much to respond. She hurt too much to even notice Mary-Ann’s own dance. The latter spoke up

“I doubt anyone noticed. And right now, I don’t care if anyone does notice.” She put her hand on Karenna’s back. Her muscles were all at attention, tight and stiff.

“You’re going to make it. It’s going to be alright. You’re strong, we’re almost there.” Mary-Ann could feel Karenna trembling. Her body was warm and clammy to the touch.

Karenna could only manage a loud exhale. She sucked her breath in. She told herself that she was not about to lose it here. Not now. But it hurt. The elevator was reaching floor 32. Maybe if she just let a little out, she could make it the rest of the way.

Mary-Ann was desperate. But he only concern right now was for Karenna. The poor woman was staring down the elevator number. She looked towards Mary-Ann, her brown eyes told the whole story. Fear, anguish and pain were all on display. Mary-Ann heard her take air in- as though she was shocked. Like a whispered yelp, Karenna turned her gaze towards Mary-Ann. A plea.

Looking down Mary-Ann could see a dark patch forming on the crotch of the young woman’s khakis. The tan pants showed everything. Karenna was only making noise in syllables. Clutching the spreading darkness, it seemed to stop as it reached her right leg. The elevator dinged. They were on the right floor.

Karenna couldn’t believe how good that felt. Once she felt it going down her leg she had done her best to stop it. As the doors opened her wet panties and damp crotch taunted her. She could be relieved from this torture if she would only let go. Defying herself, she didn’t. Sarah held the door. Mary-Ann dashed out, hands cupping her own privates. Karenna could hardly walk, her tired muscles now had a taste of relief. Sarah stepped out. Karenna followed down the hallway.

Mary-Ann swiped the keycard and Sarah was about to hold the door when Karenna mustered her strength for one final appeal.

“I…can’t…I won’t m-make i-it. The bathroom…the corner…please Sarah.” Karenna pointed around the next hallway where there was an extra restroom for the floor’s guests.

Sarah closed the door to their room and led the desperate Karenna around the corner without saying a word.

Mary-Ann ran passed the living area and through their bedroom. She threw open the bathroom door and saw her salvation. Quickly lifting the seat, she felt a dripple escape her privates and begin to wet her panties. She went to unzip her pants. Stuck. She jimmied them again. Stuck. As a streak of pee began to run down Mary-Ann’s leg as she let go of her jammed zipper. To no one in particular she called out

“Screw this.”

Kicking off her heels, she jumped into the shower behind her, and relaxed. Not caring about the consequences, Mary-Ann started to pee in her dress pants. Moaning in relief and filled with the joy of her secret naughty pleasure, she closed her eyes. She could feel it warming her legs. It was running through her panties and splattering the shower floor with a loud, distinctive smack. She was used to it, but the fact that she figured Sarah and Karenna were right outside the door made it even more pleasurable. Leaning against the shower wall, Mary-Ann reopened her eyes. She saw a massive wet patch on her crotch which then had two destructive flows down each leg.

Her pee was making her white pants see through, and the color of her pink panties was obvious to anyone with eyes. She could feel the flowing urine wetting the backs of her legs as well, which met with her pee that had moved down her thighs. They both met at the cuffs of her pant legs and created a flow over each foot. Her puddle was quickly draining out of the shower. Even as she was finishing adding to it, Mary-Ann began to rub at her crotch, spreading the remaining pee stream around her entire nether region. She had mostly finished soiling her dress pants, but couldn’t help snaking a hand down the front of the ruined pants to play with herself. She was now incredibly horny.

Karenna could see the bathroom door. Her legs were shaking against her own wishes. Every muscle wanted to relax, the devil on her shoulder wanted her to just give up. But she couldn’t. Mary-Ann’s words rang through her head. You’re going to make it. Your strong. Sarah held the light swinging door for her. Shambling her way inside, the perfect white tile accented the three blue stalls. There was a counter. It had 3 skinks. Starting to feel dizzy. Lightheaded. Sarah ran into an open stall. Karenna needed support. The counter. She grabbed it with all her might. She watched Sarah’s heels under the stall. They danced. They clicked in front of the toilet. She tuned around. Karenna couldn’t move. It was over she knew what was coming. She closed her eyes out of exhaustion.

“Are you ok?” She hadn’t even noticed the very thin 18 or 19 year old at the farthest sink. She weakly responded

“I…I’m f-fine…I just ne-need…I” Karenna stopped.

She heard it. A loud hiss emanated from Sarah’s stall. The sound of the water. It was too much. Karenna’s bladder gave one final push. She finished her sentence.

“ahh…I’m pissing myself.”

It came out slowly. A lowly trickle when compared to the noise Sarah’s was making, but it was wetting Karenna’s panties. As a thin dark streak ran down her tan pants, the other girl finally saw what was going on

“Yooo, are you serious right now?”

Karenna could only respond in moans of relief. She thought about stopping when the streak of urine had reached her kneecaps, but the pleasure was too much. Though it was hard to hear over Sarah’s, Karenna could swear she heard a dull hiss emanating from her own crotch. The seat of her pants felt warm, and as she began to soak the backs of her legs, the stream down the inseam of her pants had started to reach her feet. Without much speed, her flowing piss did not create a puddle underneath Karenna.

Rather, as it poured over her feet and into her flats, it waterlogged them, and poured out onto the tile floor. A shiver ran down the length of Karenna’s spine. Her leg began to twitch at the warmth and relief from holding it for so long. As her pussy continued to pass warm pee into her panties, Karenna became acutely aware of her finally deflating bladder. She could only exhale as she fully let go, and though her stream wasn’t releasing any faster, Karenna certainly wasn’t pretending that she was going to stop anytime soon.

As Sarah dried her wet tuff of public hair, she dropped her final toilet paper square into the bowl and flushed. Sighing at the relief of finally letting go, she pulled her panties back up and her dress back down. As she exited the stall, her litigious brain was not prepared for the scene she faced.

A very thin younger girl, no older than 20 was snickering and repeating to herself the phrase “Oh my God.” Hearing Sarah open the stall she turned her head, with her backwards-facing ballcap and laughingly proclaimed

“This chick is seriously pissing herself!” She pointed “Look at that!”

Almost not wanting to accept what her eyes were telling her, Sarah saw Karenna standing in an expanding puddle. Her hand was still nominally over her crotch, but her once tan khakis were now a dark shade as clear liquid ran down her thighs. Karenna had her head down and her face away from whoever was watching as the other woman gawked again

“I wish my phone was charged; oh man, friends are not going to believe this!”

“Well get out of here and go tell them then.” Sarah motioned for the door.

The woman looked confused. She wanted to stay and watch the spectacle. But nonetheless, she complied, calling Karenna gross on her way out. Sarah assessed the situation

“Are you done?”

Karenna grimaced “Almost.”

“Then stop and go into a stall. Stop disgracing yourself.” Sarah was stern

Karenna managed to cut off the rest of her pee for now, though her overworked bladder protested, Karenna knew the second wave would be pressing on her soon. She just hoped Sarah would be caring. She wanted to cry.

“This is unacceptable.” Sarah folded her arms. “You carry Mary-Ann’s company name, her reputation, is this how you want to represent that?”

Karenna thought back to what Mary-Ann had already done, but remained silent.

“You’re her second in charge, you might be running the show one day, but you can’t find a bathroom in a building with one on every floor.” Sarah raised her voice “How old are you?”

“T-twenty-three…” Karenna just didn’t want to cry at this point

“23 years old and you don’t know when to go to the bathroom.

“I-I-I was b-but yo-“

“Don’t you DARE pin this on me.” Sarah was livid “I happen to trust that an adult knows when she needs to go, I happened to mistake you for an adult.” Sarah paused, her rage overwhelmed her “Are you a FUCKING animal? Do you piss on the floor everywhere else?”

“P-please I’m embar-“ Karenna started to stammer

“YOU’RE embarrassed? I’m the one that’s going to have to tell Mary-Ann that her understudy just pissed her pants and all over the floor.” Sarah stopped again, attempting to control her voice. At a lower volume, she continued “If you were my employee, this would be a fire-able offence you know. I don’t know what Mary-Ann’s policies are but I’m sure they’re similar. I would start packing my things if I were you. And don’t ask for a reference from either one of us when you’re looking for another job. I just hope you can make it past your first day without peeing your pants.” Sarah let out an exasperated sigh. Her rage dwindling

Karenna felt her second urge hit. Normally she would have stayed on the toilet until it hit her again, but feeling so defeated, she didn’t want to move. As it built up pressure with the remainder of her pee, she let it out again. This flow was much faster. Sarah started to walk over to the paper towel dispenser on the wall behind Karenna. She started to speak again.

“Look. I liked your friend. You obviously can network well, but…” Sarah heard a hiss coming from Karenna again. The puddle underneath her began to splatter as new droplets fell from her pants

“Karenna? A-are you peeing again?”

Karenna nodded. Sarah put her head in her hands.

“Ugh. I can’t do this right now. You should be ashamed- that’s filthy.” She paused to control her voice “I shouldn’t have to be telling a 23 year old woman to stop peeing her pants for the second time in 5 minutes.”

Karenna’s legs dripped as she finished. Finally empty. There was an awkward silence. Sarah spoke again.

“Here, lets at least get you back in your room and tell the hotel what happened.”

“N-no. Please. No one has to know. I-I’ll do anything, I’ll g-give you anything” Karenna begged

“You don’t have anything I want.” She grabbed a few paper towels from the dispenser “Dry your cuffs. I don’t want you dripping all over hell and creation.”

She stood next to Karenna as the ashamed woman did as she was told. Part of her didn’t want to accept any of this as real. But she had too. Her pants were heavy and cold and there was no denying that. Sarah led her back out of the bathroom and into an alcove with a landline phone. She dialed the front desk.

“Yes, hi, could you send a janitor to the bathroom on floor 32? My colleague had an accident.”

Embarrassed, Karenna turned to the painting of a tomato on the wall. She wish she was just a painting at this point. Her emotions were all stirring just below the surface. All of them negative. Sarah was still talking to the front desk

“No, no blood, she’s ok. She wet her pants. There’s um…uh puddle on the floor.”

As Sarah continued to talk, a family must have walked by. Karenna could hear a womanly voice

“Justin, we don’t point, that’s rude.”

As they traveled down the hallway she could hear a rebuttal “Did you see though? She peed her pants!”

Karenna felt cold. Helpless. Sarah walked her back to her room. She dug the room key out of her back pocket. It was damp. Wet. Soaked from her accident. The door unlocked and to their surprise, Mary-Ann was still in the bathroom.

Mary-Ann sat on the floor of the shower. Enjoying the unexpected wetting and the lack of consequences so far. Part of her wondered where Karenna and Sarah went, but she assumed they just went down to eat and would text her shortly. She heard the door click with a key card. Leaping up from the shower, Mary-Ann locked the bathroom door to prevent anyone from barging in. She heard Sarah’s voice.

“Mary-Ann? Could we get a moment? We’ve got a situation here.”

Unlocking the door, Mary-Ann stuck her head out. She saw Sarah standing in her bedroom doorway, and Karenna behind her. With soaked pants.

“Karenna didn’t quite make it-“ Sarah was about to continue when Mary-Ann stepped out.

“Well, that’s okay. Neither did I.”

Sarah put her head in her hands when she saw Mary-Ann’s soaked white pants. Backing away she took her hands off her face

“You guys have fun with that then. I-I’ll see you later.” She opened the door

“We’re still on for dinner?” Mary-Ann walked by Karenna into the living area.

“No…No, I think I’m good.” Sarah left

Mary-Ann was about to say something when she heard Karenna begin to whine. Before she could even react, the poor girl began to sob.
