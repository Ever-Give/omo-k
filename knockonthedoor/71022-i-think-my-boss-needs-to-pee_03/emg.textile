This line is so awesome, it will make it into the story, trust me!

I’m glad Tyler came across the way I was intending. I love going with the reverse setup, Where he was billed as some dopey jock, but is actually sensitive and intelligent. Next update is looking like this Wednesday, just realized I forgot to add that!

A/N: Here's the start of Chapter 4. And it should be a great one! For fans of desperation, and lots of it, this one is right up your ally. We have a total of 3 peeing girls and all of them are desperate. In their office no less! I feel like this chapter is sort of a "return to form" It was really fun to write! Also, 50 free internet points to the person who can find the nod to Peehour's excellent story called "Told To." Question I have for you this time around is: What do you think happened to Anna? It's a plot point later, trust me! Lastly, as always, feedback, good or bad, is not only appreciated but encouraged. So many of you have so many great ideas and your own additions to the story.

4.1: Cassie's first lesson

She couldn’t remember where she was. It certainly wasn’t her bed. Cassie had to think about what she had done last night. Was it one guy or two? It didn’t matter. Didn’t she have that interview this morning? Looking for her phone was a hassle. She pulled her skirt back down over her pierced labia. Someone had taken her panties. They could have them. She couldn’t find her phone around her, it wasn’t on the table next to her. It wasn’t on the floor. Maybe it was under the pizza box? No. Squinting, she could make out a blinking light on the bathroom counter. She wandered over to it, swearing as she stubbed her toe on some discarded item. The dark floor was covered in them. The bathroom mirror was cracked, but with the bright sun shining through the window, Cassie could see her phone on the counter. She was nearly an hour late.

With almost no time to commute, she quickly fixed her lipstick, which had been smudged by someone. She was glad that she had worn her shorter black skirt. It was sexy, but still looked good enough for an interview in her opinion. On her way out, she took a swig of an open Vodka bottle. In her haste, it clanked off of her nose ring, she had moved to fast. She rubbed her now stinging nose as she closed the door behind her. She ran her hands through her dyed blonde hair. Her natural curls went well with the natural brown accents she had left in.

As she got in her car, she couldn’t help but yawn, still tired. She put her Rock-and-Roll playlist on and turned up the volume. She found Sarah’s text from a few weeks ago, with the address listed. As she pulled out from whatever dumpy apartment she had spent the night in, her bladder asked her if it could be relieved. Last night’s alcohol needed a place to go. With the commute that she faced, and the little time she had to complete it, there was simply no way.

Dodging cars and weaving though traffic, Cassie was making great time. As she rolled past a stop sign, another motorist honked at her. She flipped them off as she sped along the residential roads. Her bare pussy rubbed against the drivers seat as she did, sending a little pleasure up her spine. Her bladder responded, reminding Cassie that it still needed to be voided. As she finally halted at a red light, she turned her song up louder. Hoping to shake off her still groggy state. And to drown out her bladder’s remarks. If she was still going to have time to get a coffee in order to be alert for her interview, she couldn’t waste time looking for a place to pee. It didn’t help that she area she was in wasn’t the best part of town, a consequence of hanging out at a bar on up and coming side.

As she reached the highway, the entrance ramp was slow. It wasn’t too long of a trip on the highway but morning traffic would nonetheless get in the way. Cassie could start to feel her bladder, more than she would like, but holding it wouldn’t be an issue. She pulled out of one lane and moved to the next, attempting to outflank the slow moving traffic. As she did, she was able to get onto the main highway, though another motorist gave her a honk. She didn’t bother with flipping them off this time around. It was a three lane highway, enough for most of the traffic volume, but the last of the morning rush had slowed her travel to levels well below normal highway speed. Her rock music continued to blast out of her car. 

She didn’t know if others could hear it and she didn’t care. It was a good song anyway. A car had it hazards on and was barely moving. Whatever their issue was, it wasn’t Cassie’s problem. She swerved around them into the breakdown lane. As she rode the rumble strips her bladder yelled at her. She could feel it tightening, warning her that it should not be trifled with this day. But Cassie was always good at holding it. She didn’t care about using whatever public bathroom she had to, but never wanted to break the seal at a bar. This was more of the same. And besides, it was probably just her mind playing a nervous trick on her.

Monday was always a stressful day. For Mary-Ann it wasn’t the dread of going to work that so many others carried with them, but every Monday, she could count on one thing- meetings. And they were all of the utmost importance. The first was always a planning meeting, which was combined with their client and case overview. Both Karenna and Mary-Ann would speak, while Anna diligently took notes. As Mary-Ann finished her part of the planning meeting, she could feel her bladder begin to ask for relief.

“And Karenna, your now way over your target for this month. Great job on closing the Franklin’s mortgage.”

“It wasn’t that much of a hassle boss. And no size is ever too small.” She said that more for Anna’s sake

“That’s right!” Mary-Ann commended Karenna for taking every client seriously. A principle she preached.

“And the right motivation helps.” She gave Karenna a wink, knowing that a girls trip was her reward

Karenna smiled back. Anna was too busy taking down notes to notice the exchange. Mary-Ann asked Anna to read back her notes, a review of their goals for the rest of the year. As the shy girl read aloud, Mary-Ann could feel her bladder swelling. Her workout routine always caused her to drink plenty, and after her mishap at her old office, she stopped drinking coffee on Monday’s. Even after her adjustment, it still felt like every Monday began with a hold. Not that she was complaining. But after her subtle wetting with Tyler yesterday, she wasn’t in the mood for a another, her typical ending at home to a Monday workday. Anna had finished her spiel, it was on the mark. As Mary-Ann continued towards the second half of their meeting, she tightened her hold, unsure of when her next break would come.

Why did Cassie decide to stop for a coffee? As she sat in the drive-thru, She clenched her thighs together. It was an odd sensation. To be nearly groggy enough to fall asleep at the wheel, but also have an urge to pee. The two competed for her attention, though she chose to ward off her desire for sleep. That’s what got her in this short line. Her denial of her other need had caused her thighs to nearly touch. Her bare pussy felt warm in the heated car, though her labia piercing rested comfortably at a cool temperature. She looked at her GPS. The office wasn’t far from where she was, Cassie would be just on time. The car in front of her pulled around, it was Cassie’s turn to order, and the voice on the other end asked her what she wanted

“Yeah, could I get a pee- I mean, shit, I meant an Iced coffee, no sugar or cream.”

The woman taking her order either didn’t care. Having worked in customer service for long enough, Cassie could empathize. You’re such a dumbass Cassie she thought as she fought back another pang of desperation. It wasn’t getting any easier to hold it. Observing the scenery around her, the coffee shop was next to an open field. While clearly vacant, it would provide her no cover if she were to jump out and squat. A smile crossed her tired face as she remembered her senior prom night. Eighteen was an important year for her, but the heavy drinking that night had taught her one thing, when you got to go, you go to go. Just don’t let the cops see you.

Her thoughts were interrupted as her bladder asked her to repeat her actions that night. Or any night, when the walk home from the bar was too long. Cassie responded by holding herself. It was the middle of the morning, and she could not afford the time loss, nor could she risk someone getting too offended. When Cassie pulled up to the window, she couldn’t help but keep her hand over her crotch. While she wasn’t grabbing it, doing so had enough of a psychological effect that it numbed her need a little bit. Her phone was scanned, and she got her coffee. As she pulled out of the drive thru and through the parking lot, She hoped her first long sip would eviscerate her sleep addled brain. Hardly. But her bladder reacted, protesting up her spine. In response, Cassie squirmed in her seat. She was starting to get uncomfortable. At this rate, she hoped she could have a chance to pee once she got there. Or if they had a parking garage, that might do too.

As their morning meeting was finally ending, Mary-Ann had started to shift her weight from hip to hip. As hard as she was trying to not show any outward desperation, she couldn’t help herself. Karenna, still sitting across from Anna, was finishing her discussion on clients she was looking to close this week, and their potential problems. Anna was furiously scribbling her comments down on her notepad. Mary-Ann grabbed her right arm with her left hand, attempting to put enough pressure somewhere else to distract her body from the pressure in her abdomen. She stood as straight as she could, curling her toes inside her heels to keep herself occupied. Suddenly there was a fury of movement. Both Mary-Ann and Karenna looked at Anna. The dark haired girl, with her fluffy braids, shot upwards. Her hands clutching the front of her pencil skirt.

“E-excuse me” She weakly said as she dashed out of the conference room.

Mary-Ann’s eyes were wide. She felt for the poor girl. Karenna looked equally as worried.

“Is she ok?” Mary-Ann asked

“I hope so. I think…I think she just went to the bathroom.”

“She could have just asked. Kind of envy her right now though.”

“Don’t tell me the three of us are in the same boat.”

Mary-Ann gave a knowing smile to her friend “I haven’t had a chance all morning.” She bobbed her knees again

“Then I guess that does make three of us, boss.”

“You too?”

“You have no idea.” Karenna grabbed herself, and squirmed in her chair. “In fact-“

The glass doors swung back open. Anna clicked a new pen.

“Out of ink.” She didn’t look like she was being honest

“Anna, are you ok?” Mary-Ann was still concerned

“Yeah!” She said a little too cheerfully. “I’m ok, really.” She looked at Karenna. “The two of you have things to get to right after this, can we just move on? I’m fine really. I’m good.”

Without anything to counter what Anna said, Mary-Ann let the meeting continue. As Karenna resumed her talk, Mary-Ann scribbled down a note to check in with Anna later. As she bent forward she felt a hot rush towards her opening. She cursed herself for standing the whole time. But she felt she had to take some authority. Even if it caused her bladder discomfort.

As Cassie and her car crested the top of the hill, she could see a number of different office buildings. The way the town had designed it, was to run the main avenue parallel to the highway. In the wide space between the two, a number of different malls, office buildings and auto dealerships dotted the once expansive farmland. This was all suddenly interesting to Cassie, who was absent-mindedly grinding her uncovered muff into her driver’s seat. She took another long drink from her coffee, in an attempt to finish it before her interview. Hopefully it would just get her to normal. But the occasional ping of desperation had turned into a dull ache. And no amount of gawking at any office building was going to relieve it. She was just happy the avenue was wide enough for multiple lanes. She would be on time.

As their meeting wrapped up, Mary-Ann bent down over the conference room table to gather her things. In an effort to keep her urine in its place, she crossed her pantyhose clad legs. As she stood, a jolt of desperation took her entire body. Her legs wobbled briefly. She was still worried about Anna.

“Hey, Anna, are you sure you’re ok? If you’re not feeling well, I understand.”

“No. Thank you.” She turned red “Really, it’s nothing.”

“Are you positive?” Mary-Ann crossed her legs again.

“Yup!” Anna said that again too cheerfully “I’ll have the rest of you schedule for you, and on your desk in a moment.” She turned and left through the glass doors.

“I think you pried a little too hard there boss.” Karenna stood

“Yeah. You’re right.” She exhaled, more from desperation than anything else. Her legs wiggled

“I’m with you there!” Karenna checked to make sure Anna hadn’t seen her and squeezed her legs together. A slight exaggeration of her own need

“You know, I had to wait that whole time. What should I do if I can’t hold it?”

“Kar, you know that’s a hard rule. Trust me, if the two of us were in about 100 other places right now, I’d already be standing in a puddle. But what’s my rule?”

Karenna knew it, but she spoke in an overly exasperated tone “No playing in the office…”

“Right. Now if you’ll excuse me…”

“Wait, you’re going first?”

“Kar, I’m not kidding, I really got to pee.” Mary-Ann wasn’t exaggerating as she bent forward. Her legs crossing

“Neither am I!” She clutched her high-waisted navy blue dress pants. They went surprisingly well with her green blouse “Although…I don’t think it’d show on these…”

“Kar!”

“Kidding! Kidding! But my first meeting is with the Jefferson’s. You know they’re talkers. If you don’t let me go first, I really will be standing in a puddle.”

Mary-Ann sighed “Fine…but only because your my best friend.”

Karenna put her hand to her heart. She was touched “best?”

“In the whole world.”

“Love you too!” As Karenna said it, it had a different meaning for her

Mary-Ann smiled. Then shot her hands into her grey pencil skirt, twisting her heeled feet towards one another. “Now, please hurry!”

As Karenna exited the double glass doors she teased back “I don’t know, you look good like that!”

Mary-Ann playfully stuck her tongue out. The two chuckled as they parted. Walking to her personal office, Mary-Ann hoped against hope that she’d have time to pee before Cassie showed up.

At least their building had a parking garage. Cassie was relived as she entered on the street level. The garage balanced the entire building on top of it. The first level wrapped was full. As she maneuvered down to the second level, the lurch in the ramp caused Cassie’s bladder to press even harder on her bare snatch. It was hard to drive when all she wanted to do was cross her legs. At least the second level was relatively open. She found a place to park. Finishing her iced coffee in one sip, the cool rush only served to anger her already agitated bladder. As she stepped out of the car, she held herself. The warmth from her genitals was obvious. She crossed her legs. She finally admitted her need to herself. Scanning the garage, she saw plenty of open spaces. Not many cars she could squat behind. Maybe she could pretend to be looking for something?

Opening her drivers side door again, she bent forward, sticking her upper half into the cabin. She relaxed. As warm sensation began to rush towards her slit. She was finally going to be comfortable again. Voices. Knowing that her ass was in plain sight and the act she was about to commit, she stood up. In an attempt to halt her piss she clamped both her walls shut. As she clutched them both tight, pain emanated from her pierced labia. She felt the slightest bit of warmth wet both sides of her flesh. A group of business people walked by. The first few didn’t notice her, but a sharply dress woman with a ponytail did. Her jaw dropped. She motioned to Cassie. The interviewee was exposed. She let out a fake cough as she pulled her skirt back down. It covered her. But it wouldn’t cover her if she started pissing uncontrollably. And with the dull ache of her bladder now a thumping hammer, she feared that it was only a matter of time.

As Karenna set her things down in her own office, she mulled over her conversation with Mary-Ann again. She knew her mind should be on her work, but that spark that she got from her boss. No one else could do it to her. She needed a little more play. Before she set off for the bathroom, she sent Chloe a text. The two had been chatting off and on for a day or so.

Just finished my morning meeting. I gotta pee soooo bad!!

It would have been a slightly risky text, but after Chloe’s commanding night, she knew it would be well received.

Walking out of her office and down the hall, Karenna was trying to stay composed. She was more horny than anything else. In an effort to keep her head down and her arousal low, she looked at the floor. Walking right by the entrance doors, she didn’t even notice that Cassie had just arrived. Her phone buzzed. It was Chloe

I don’t believe you

Surprised, Karenna sent a text back

If you only knew 😰 legs crossed!

Her phone immediately buzzed back

A quick video would prove it

Karenna felt even more naughty as she opened the door to the bathroom. She loved the idea. The unisex room housed one urinal and one stalled toilet. The large mirror overlooked the sink.

As Karenna’s heels clicked and clacked off of the white tiled floor, she opened the stall door. Slipping off her dress pants and panties, she sat down. Holding it for a moment while she got her phone to record. She felt her desperation increase rapidly as it did. She started to drip. But she wasn’t going to try and stop the leak. Instead, she pushed record, and held the phone close, a selfie for this entrancing woman on the other side.

Karenna smiled at the forward facing camera. It was the first thing that was recorded. Then the first sound. The dripping. The dripping became louder. Then a trickle, which soon became a hiss. It bellowed throughout the bathroom. Full force, Karenna pissed into the toilet. And her phone captured the whole thing. She pulled the phone closer, her mouth close to the microphone. She whispered, just over the sound of her splashing urine and hissing body.

“Told you I had to pee.” She spoke in a sultry voice “You should have seen me. I could barely hold this all in. I was squirming, and grabbing…”

She wondered if she should let Chloe in on her other interest. Maybe just a tease.

“I almost wet my pants…but you know what? I liked it.” She whispered in that same sultry tone “I like it when you know how bad your little K has to pee.”

She gave Chloe one last shot of her pussy expelling her piss into the toilet. She gave the phone a kiss. And pushed send. You should have seen Mary-Ann. And how bad she had to pee. She couldn’t get the image out of her head. The one thing she couldn’t have. And as her strong stream finally died down. She couldn’t help but feel a little lonely. Chloe or not. Her phone buzzed.

Look what you made me do!

A picture. Chloe had spread herself. An arc of piss was flying out of her, a looked like it would soon hit her floor. Another text

You better get over here soon. I need to punish you for that!

Karenna sent back Next week?

As Karenna released another quick few seconds of her pee, Chloe confirmed the day and sent another picture, this time of her fingers inside herself. Karenna might still feel a little lonely, but at least Chloe could giver her the best sex she’s ever had.

Why does she hate me? Cassie wondered as Karenna walked by her towards the bathroom.

She ignored you on purpose. Cassie reminded herself of why Because you don’t know how to act at a lunch meeting you moron. Didn’t Sarah tell you that?

Cassie approached the front desk. A pretty girl in a white blouse sat behind it. She looked up

“Uh…hi, I-I’m Cassie.” She exhaled. It was either nerves or because her pounding bladder was going to break through any minute. She hoped it was the latter

“Oh, Mary-Ann’s interview. Great, I’ll let her know.” She looked down at Cassie’s legs. They were trembling

“Our uh...bathroom’s right down the hall. It’s occupied right now but-“

“Uh, no, no. No that’s fine…” Cassie made a point of peering at the name plate on her desk “…Anna, I just…It’s nerves is all. You know? Just nervous.”

“Oh.” Anna didn’t look like she bought Cassie’s excuse. Cassie didn’t either “Well, you’ll like Mary-Ann, she’s really friendly. Not like other bosses.”

Cassie nodded. She kept trying to tell herself that she was just nervous. That was all.

Mary-Ann laid out her interview questions on her desk. Her feet were shuffling, and the only thing she could do to stop it was to cross them. She felt relieved that at least she was going to be able to find relief after Karena. It was a new office, and she wasn’t going to ruin the rug in this one too. Let alone in front of someone who had a connection to Sarah. Sighing and preening her blouse, Mary-Ann opened the light wooden door. She rounded the bend to find Cassie, standing and chatting with Anna. At least I have some practice. You’re Mary-Ann, you only pee when you want to. She wasn’t all that confident, but it was something to tell herself.

“You must be Cassie!” Mary-Ann shook her hand

Way to say my name wrong Cassie thought to herself. But it was at least an attempt. Sarah only called her “c”.

The two briefly chatted about the ride over here, Cassie omitting her nighttime escapades and bladder situation on the way over. A situation which cruelly reminded her of its urgent need. Before she sat down in the computer chair that had been provided for her, she pretzeled her legs. The pounding of her bladder was only getting worse.

As Mary-Ann sat behind her desk, she was thankful that Cassie couldn’t see underneath it. She crossed her legs as she sat. She gently rocked herself back and forth. It was going to be a long interview, but Mary-Ann was determined to make it through.

“So, is it Cas-see, or K-see”

“K-see. But my mother thought it would be cute if she spelled it wrong.” Cassie hoped that it didn’t have too much venom in it.

“Well…K-see. Sell me this pen.” Mary-Ann handed her a nice pen. Her own desperation had caused her to pause

Cassie took it in her hand. It had good weight, a quality pen. She whished she could put it inside her. Maybe that would plug up the piss that was pounding on her closed walls. It was close.

“Well, why? Do you…” Cassie had to pause. Hold her waters back “do you need a pen?”

“Um…” Mary-Ann crossed her legs again. Her foot accidently kicked the inside of her desk. It sent shockwaves up her body. “Uh, sure. I nee-need a pen.” Mary-Ann caught her self nearly saying the word pee

“Well-“ Cassie shifted. She took an unnatural position on her chair, straddling it, so that her bare minge rubbed the mesh. She leaned forward, keeping her skirt in front of her.

“Well, M-Mary-Ann. You’re a-a-a great business woman.” Cassie could hardly think straight. She felt light-headed

“Your competition is buttoned up. S-s-so m-much in fact tha-“ She felt something. It tickled her walls. She knew it passed her piercing. She couldn’t believe it if she had. But she’d have to check in a moment.

“They have good, no great pens. I-if you’ve got a cheap one. That could be the difference.”

That was her pitch. Cut short. She needed to feel. She swiped her hand over the mesh underneath her. She had peed on the seat. She now had a question of Mary-Ann

“Um...h-how m-much longer? Are there a lot of questions?”

“Why? Somewhere to be?”

“N-no, just nerves. I g-get that way sometimes.”

“Do you need a break? Some water maybe?” Mary-Ann’s own bladder kicked her for that. She clenched her muscles

“No! I d-don’t need it. I’m- I’m good.” Cassie smiled

Mary-Ann nodded. Her next question was about ethics. Cassie gave a generic response that stemmed from her first college course in ethics. It seemed to satisfy Mary-Ann, but not Cassie’s bladder. It kicked again, rushing more warm liquid towards her opening. Cassie rubbed against the mesh. It was slight sexual stimulation, enough to halt her pee. For now. But she still felt dizzy. Mary-Ann asked another question. This one was about regulation. Cassie responded

“T-the b-best way to deal with…with regulation is…what S-Sarah taught me…” Cassie felt it again.

This one was a trickle. It was passing through her walls without her permission. She didn’t want to pee. She just wanted to hold on to the lie that she was nervous. It slowed. Then a jet of hot pee squirted its way out of her. It wet the seat. But the seat held for now. The sensation caused Cassie to interrupt her own sentence

“UM! Ah…yeah…so. That’s that.”

Mary-Ann grabbed her own crotch under the desk “That’s what?”

“Y-you know”

“Cassie…you didn’t finish.” An urge kicked Mary-Ann. She was near her limit

“Well, what I meant was.” Another one. This one was longer.

Cassie grabbed her fleshy walls shut. The surge of hot piss instead cascaded over her hand. It wet her piercing. She tried as hard as she could to close it off. It slowed to a trickle, but didn’t stop.

Mary-Ann saw Cassie grab. No matter how discrete it was, Mary-Ann knew what the issue was. She had learned early on that discretion was the better part of valor. Her gut was telling her to hire this woman. If she kept drilling her and the inevitable happened, Mary-Ann knew they would both end up wet. And she might lose the hire on top of that. She had to tell Cassie.

“Hey Cassie.”

The girl looked up, her face twisted into a snarl. Anger hid behind her face. Only now did it show

“I don’t think either of us is really in a condition to continue this. The bathroom is just down the way. Please. For both of our sakes. Hurry!”

Cassie’s contorted face disappeared, she bolted up from her seat

“Ohmygodthankyousomuch Mary-Ann”

Cassie walked as fast as her heels would allow. She walked right by Anna. She had one thought on her mind. If she lost another round of pee, it was over. She just could take much more. She felt it welling up within her. The bathroom door was so close. She pushed it, it opened for her. The white tile and the stall door, they were hers. She swung open the door.

And her bladder won. Cassie stood there, looking at the toilet, her snatch hissing as a heavy stream of piss poured out. The sound on the clean tile floor was undeniable. It took Cassie a second to register that she was even peeing. She felt like a primitive woman. She felt good, and that’s all she knew. But as it ran down one of her legs, she hobbled over to the toilet, and sat herself down. Her stream began anew as she finally let all of her psychological barriers down. She put her head in her hands. She knew Mary-Ann and Sarah ran in the same circles, and if Mary-Ann was anything like her, the piss on the floor was the nail in the coffin for her job opportunity.

The door suddenly swung open. Cassie was about to yell that it was occupied, but whomever it was, was moving quickly. Their heels hardly touched the ground they were in such a rush. Over the sound of her own deflating bladder, Cassie heard a loud tearing sound. She peered under the stall door. The pair of heels were lined up with their backs against the wall. A loud gushing sound followed. It wasn’t the same hiss that was now dying down from her own body, but a strong sturdy rush. Cassie was confused, were they pissing against a wall? It had to be Mary-Ann. Thinking back on their interview, Mary-Ann had told her to hurry. It had to be her. If she’s anything like Sarah, serves her right!

As Cassie wiped herself and threw the used toilet paper into the toilet, she waited on exiting the stall. She was sure that Sarah would have made her clean the puddle that she made in front of the toilet. Why would she do that for a job she probably didn’t get? Cassie instead sat on the toilet and listened to the other lady spray, something. Cassie wasn’t even sure what was there. Was it just a wall? Did she make this woman, potentially her boss, piss on a wall? Her urine was clear, it was hard to tell, but Cassie was sure she could see a small puddle forming on the floor as well.

A familiar sensation tickled Cassie’s labia piercing. She looked down. More pee was slowly leaking from her. The other woman’s stream finally slowed. It wasn’t very long before it stopped completely. Then there was rustling. A flush. Cassie was confused. They walked to the sink, washed their hands and left.

Cassie grimaced as she stepped her heel into her own puddle. It was cold as some of the residue splashed onto her shoe. She washed her own hands and started for the door. It was the urinal. That’s what the woman had used. As she exited the bathroom, she saw Mary-Ann speaking with Anna. Confirming that the two desperate woman had just loudly pissed next to each other. There were very small streaks that led down Mary-Ann’s pantyhose, which must have been the tearing sound. She had to have bent over, and small rivulets must have made their way down her legs. Mary-Ann turned, facing Cassie before she walked out.

“Cassie, what’s the one thing you learned today?”

How the hell could I learn something from a cliché sales trick and 2 questions I wasn’t paying attention to. Just deny me the job for pissing on your floor and chair like you want to and let me mess up my life in peace.

Cassie stuttered. She’d at least leave with a little dignity and give an answer. Thinking back on the experience, though, one thing did stick out to her. Mary-Ann noticed her need. Mary-Ann admitted they were in the same boat and showed her mercy in her time of need. That was it!

“Mercy”

Mary-Ann raised an eyebrow. “Really?”

“Yeah. You didn’t have to cut the interview short, but you did. To…” She looked at Anna. Embarrassed to outright admit what happened. “To save me, when you didn’t have to.”

It was a better lesson than Mary-Ann had expected

“Cassie, that was really insightful. I’d be happy to have you on the team.”

“D-does that mean?”

Mary-Ann extended her hand “Welcome aboard. We start Wednesday”

Cassie couldn’t help but smile. She shook Mary-Ann’s hand. As her new boss walked away, Cassie made her way to the door. She stopped and turned to Anna. She had time for one sarcastic joke

“I swear it was just nerves.”

Anna smiled wide as she shook her head “Yeah, they got us all today.” She waved

“See you Wednesday Cassie”

A/N: So, what do you think of Cassie? Is she different than the other girls we've spent time with before? Do you like her as a character and becoming a main one at that? Also, Anna was introduced, and don't forget the question: Why do you think she left the meeting in such a hurry? And did you find the reference to "Told To"?

Was the reference the bit where Karenna is sending Chloe the pictures?

Anyways great chapter!

}}

Not quite! But here’s a hint, check out the name of one of the houses that Karenna worked on the mortgage for. I believe that Tori had the last name of Franklin.

Thanks for the support! How did you like Cassie and the way she’s written?

Normally, desperation stories seem to drag on for me, since it seems like they just kill time, but this one kept me engaged and interested. The story and scenes still progressed as they all held themselves. Nice job!

I like Cassie, she's definitely a more carefree character (having a one-night stand before an interview, and showing up to that interview still in her 'walk of shame' outfit). She definitely adds another unique personality to the office, and I enjoyed her perspective of the story, it was well-written!

I'm probably giving the obvious, "that's what I want you to think" answer to where Anna ran off to. Seems to me that she was also desperate the entire time. I'm not sure if she was still desperate when she came back to the meeting - maybe she leaked, panicked, ran out to inspect the damage / change panties, then came back? I guess we'll have to wait and see! (But when she said the nerves got her too at the end, that all but confirmed to me that it was something pee-related).

I completly echo what you’re saying about desperation stories. I was trying so hard to avoid that in this chapter. You know, I don’t want to waste a readers time, but I also don’t want to make them seem desperate out of nowhere. Do you think the constantly changing perspective helped with that?

It’s interesting that your take away from Cassie is that she’s carefree, but I totally see where you’re coming from! My intention was to make her more of like a “tough girl”, where she just doesn’t care, or have the modesty of a Karenna or Mary-Ann. But I think the carefree side of her could be explored in future scenes. This is mostly her chapter after all.

Lastly, I think you’re right about Anna. I know it seemed obvious that she would be rushing off to a bathroom, but I think you hit the nail on the head! Seemed like her desperation just came up out of nowhere though…Maybe that’ll come up again.

I think you’ll get a kick out of the next part too. Without giving it all away, it may feature a deliberate wetting…

I also chose to describe Mary-Ann’s peeing scene through the ears of Cassie. Did that still work as a good descriptor?

This is one of my favorite chapters! I personally don't mind long desperation stories, but I still think you made the right choice in changing perspectives throughout the story. It shows that the events are happening at the same time and keeps the pace of the story. I quite like Cassie and am excited to see her introduced the dynamic.

It was really fin to write! And I'm a fan of Cassie too, I think she brings some nice differences to the table

A/N: This one is early, as I'm on a trip this weekend. Hope you enjoy some of Karenna's character development, as well as potential conflict (nothing bad or physical, but something to overcome). Sorry in advance if I can't get to all your comments right away, as I will be traveling. Still, feedback is not only encouraged, but appreciated. Did Karenna's character change at all for you in this section? Let me know!

Chapter 4.2: A Desperate Miscommunication

Karenna felt guilty. She was supposed to be seeing Chloe right? To be into her, to enjoy her. But the night before had been a Friday, and though Karenna had been tired from work, she had felt the need to call Chloe. That was the thing to do when you’re in a relationship. The conversation had turned sexual quickly, Chloe’s libido showing no bounds. Maybe Karenna had just been worn-out from her day. But she hadn’t been able to get herself there. It was a conundrum, in that moment.

When Chloe touched her, it was electric. When she was merely preforming on herself with Chloe, it was, pedestrian. She couldn’t finish. That was, until she thought of her boss. While Chole had been moaning and telling Karenna what a dirty girl she was, Karenna’s mind had wondered. When she thought of Mary-Ann, it was different. She had finished, and quickly. It was just the thought of being with Mary-Ann. Not even in a sexual way. Just the thought of her boss loving her back, in that way. Sighing, she felt guilty. Guilty for letting Chloe believe that she had made Karenna cum and guilty for involving Mary-Ann. Still, Karenna couldn’t deny how she felt.

She needed this morning. Just a break. A Saturday morning to just be herself for a little. As she laid in her new bed, with these thoughts swirling, a smile still broke through. The familiar urge of a morning pee. She had no problem admitting to herself how much fun she had with it. To have come from one of the most embarrassing moments of her life, she would have never expected such great pleasure.

Still prostrated on her bed, she looked over at her toilet. On a workday, she’d use it. But it was a Saturday. Karenna made the conscious decision to rule it out. She could repeat the events of a week ago. But her bed wasn’t protected, and she wasn’t ditching it like the last one. Still contemplating what to do about her bladder, she stood and stretched. She could at least make breakfast.

The two eggs sizzled on the skillet. It wasn’t complex, but Karenna had learned the simple recipe from her grandmother. While she waited, she scrolled through her old texts. Perhaps they could ease some of her feelings around her love life. Maybe some new insight. She came across the video she sent to Chloe. An idea. Some of the oil splattered on her white t-shirt. Wiping it, she looked down at her grey shorts. Similar to sweatpants, they were comfortable sleepwear. A smirk crossed her face. She knew what she was going to do about her morning pee. She plated the eggs. Found herself looking back through her texts to Mary-Ann. Some of it was about work. But she found a picture that Mary-Ann had sent. It was after their conversation about her mattress. Just last week. It was just her leg, but Mary-Ann had sent her a photo of her with piss stained jeans. What if Karenna sent her boss a little video?

She set the eggs down on her counter and switched her phone to a forward facing camera. She felt her morning pee sitting comfortably, waiting patiently for her command. Exhaling, she prepared herself to send a little video. She hit record

“Morning boss! Looking forward to our lunch tomorrow. I haven’t gotten the chance to use the bathroom yet, but I did want to ask you what restaurant you had in mind.” Karenna let go

She felt it immediately absorb into her short sweats. A smile, just as warm as her urine, crossed her face. She knew that Mary-Ann would know what was happening. Then the splattering came, as her gentle flow soaked through the fabric and sputtered out of her shorts. She spoke to her phone again

“Well, I guess I’m using the bathroom now.” She brought her phone down low, showing her pee cascading down her bare thighs.

She spread her legs, the flow now in one long stream splattered onto her kitchen floor. She brought the phone back to her face.

“So yeah…Just let me know where we’re going, and I’ll try to get there without peeing my pants. But it seems to be happening a lot lately.” She smiled as she stopped the recording.

As her flowing piss began to stop staining her grey shorts, Karenna dove into her breakfast. She contemplated for a moment on hitting send. That it might be too intimate. But Mary-Ann had told her that Karenna was her best friend. She had seen Karenna wet before. This wasn’t anything different. As Karenna hit send, she cast her doubts away. She enjoyed her breakfast, the early morning worries had been washed away in her wetting. As she let go again, more pee pooled in her shorts. While not all that much, it still caressed her womanhood in a warmth as her food warmed her belly. Mary-Ann was right. This was relaxing. Her phone buzzed

How about that Italian place on the pier? Karenna’s heart skipped a beat

Caffè di Terra Bagnata?

Yeah

See you there!

It was the same place she and Nia had been to. They were still doing renovations, and if her experience with Nia was anything to go by, their bathrooms were still under construction too. Did Mary-Ann know that? She hadn’t acknowledged Karenna’s video. She must know. But Mary-Ann didn’t like to play in public, she had said so herself. Karenna’s mind raced with anticipation, she grinded against her wet shorts. Imagining the two of them in a restaurant, clothes stained in piss. Her own mind attacked her with the thought that Mary-Ann still hadn’t said anything about Karenna’s video. More worry.

Karenna stood. She had finished her breakfast and cleaned off her plate. She threw down a number of paper towels onto her puddle. Had she made a mistake in sending that? Her phone buzzed again

Hey, could you not send something like that when I’m in the middle of a hold? Nearly lost it at the grocery store! Mary-Ann was unfazed. Karenna bantered back

I know you can hold it boss!

I think you’ve seen me enough times to know that I can NOT hold it 😁!

I still think some of those were on purpose 😉

🤫😇

Now in a joyous mood, Karenna turned on the tv, and curled up on the couch. She’d change out of her wet shorts. At some point. Maybe.

That afternoon found Karenna working. It was just light spreadsheet work, but it was work nonetheless. Her grey shorts were dry, but if one looked hard enough, it was obvious that Karenna had an accident. She sat now at her table, the only one in her small apartment, with her bladder comfortably filling. It had worked out for her that she didn’t need to go anywhere, and with her day set with Mary-Ann tomorrow, she might as well be productive today. But as her doorbell rang, she wondered if she would be able to continue to work. Especially if it was the package she was expecting.

The walk to the door wasn’t long, and the currier had left. But when Karenna saw the box, she left out an audible gasp. It was here, she couldn’t wait. Before she turned back inside, she let out a little bit of her hold. She watched the stained light grey sweats darken. Just a little. She stopped. Just a taste of what it could be like. If she was in public. Grabbing her parcel, she turned around, the little warm spot tickling her genitals. She heard her neighbors door unlock. Without turning to face them, Karenna pretended to study the package. She let just another spurt out. This one was harder to control. As she stopped it, another brief stream made it way out, quickly darkening her shorts again. She could feel her heart beat as she closed the door behind her. The thought of her neighbor catching her in her stained shorts, or even somehow noticing the smallest darkening spot, was enough to excite her.

Cutting open the box was quick, and Karenna excitedly pulled out the heavy plastic. She gazed upon her new mattress protector. It had been a little worrying when she made the purchase. It would show in her history, and every website she visited was bombarded with ads for incontinence products, but the fun and excitement she had last weekend could not be ignored. The thought that she could play roulette with her bladder, and potentially wake up wet was too enticing to ignore. She had teased herself already by letting out those short spirts, and the warm clammy feeling around her slit was already teasing another out. She would have to move quickly, or she might be lured into letting the rest go.

She carried the heavy cover towards her bed, and a third stream of pee joined the first two in her quickly dampening shorts. This third one was easier to stop, the excitement of trying out her new toy was a strong enough present for her to keep her water in. In a flash she tore off her sheets, exposing the unblemished mattress to the rest of the room. Attempting to put the heavy protection on was a game in of itself. The first two corners went on without an issue, but as Karenna bent down to fit the third, a longer stream of pee made its way out of her and down her leg. She held it, but jiggled her legs to keep it in.

As soon as Karenna wrapped the fourth corner over her mattress, she hopped on top of her bed. Crawling briefly on all fours, Karenna made her way to the middle of her mattress. She stood on her kneecaps, and happily pissed her shorts.

The spreading stain was quickly overwhelmed by her pussy, which was pouring out her urine. A dull noise echoed throughout her room as her pee soaked through her shorts. As it hit the plastic protection, it sounded like rainwater. The sound, the warmth, and the relief combined to give Karenna a joyful experience. Smiling, she pulled her shorts away from her. Looking inside, she could see a strong, clear stream shooting from her body. Karenna was fascinated by how forcefully it splattered against the interior fabric, and overcame the saturated fabric of her already stained shorts. She let go of her waistband, her shorts smacking her still urinating body. In an attempt to continue the pleasurable experience, Karenna grabbed her crotch, her hand was quickly immersed in her cascading urine. She rubbed, manipulating her flow up and down. As her bladder deflated, Karenna fell onto her back. Her arms spread, she let the last of her pee pool in her shorts.

A puddle was now in the middle of the bed, and Karenna could only imagine how much fun she could have. Her shorts were now warm again, and Karenna decided to enjoy the rest of her Saturday. She couldn’t wait for her lunch with Mary-Ann.

Karenna’s heart pumped with anticipation. She had convinced herself that Mary-Ann chose this restaurant on purpose. Karenna had prepared herself early. Downing an extra water before leaving. She fantasized about all of the different things they could do. If the waitress asked Karenna what she needed, she could tell her that she needed a bathroom, then let go where she sat. Or that maybe she and Mary-Ann could both wet at the door to the renovated ladies room. Each new fantasy thrilled the young black woman and she was happy to feel her bladder filling as she made her way to her lunch meeting.

For the first time in a long time, Mary-Ann was going to be late to a meeting. Though it was a social one, it didn’t excuse her tardiness. Cursing herself for leaving so late, Mary-Ann shot Karenna a text, letting her know that she was going to be a few extra minutes. Sighing as she stared out the windscreen, Mary-Ann could feel a slight twinge in her bladder. The fact that she was already late had focused her mind on one thing, just getting to the restaurant.

Karenna stood in the cold. While it certainly wasn’t summer anymore, it wasn’t yet cold enough for a jacket. Unless you stood on the pier. With the wind from the water kicking up and over the wharf, the cool air assaulted Karenna’s bladder. She paced in front of the door, ever so often she would bend her knees, a sign that she needed to pee. Those same electric feelings of getting caught in public rocked her body again. The prospect of others knowing her need was exciting. Still amazed that Mary-Ann had been the one to request that the two dine here, Karenna eagerly awaited her tall blonde boss.

Mary-Ann parked at the top of the pier. It was the only real parking lot that was close to the renovated wharf. Behind her were a number of boutique stores and small shops, and though they were closed on a Sunday, the buildings were still a lot more attractive than the factories that used to dominate the docks. In order to avoid the wide and inclined road, which Mary-Ann assumed was for service vehicles and deliveries, she took a narrow staircase down the old cobbled wall. It led her to the lone building below. That little Italian café she enjoyed so much. As she made her way to the front entrance, she saw Karenna waiting for her. Her friend was dressed in high-waisted pink jeans, which went well with her white top. Her tell-tale cantor let Mary-Ann know that Karenna may need a bathroom break. Ignoring the fact that Mary-Ann could use a stop herself, she greeted her friend.

Karenna was jealous of Mary-Ann as she hugged her boss. She could pull off any outfit, her white pants, while casual, were still fashionable. Her darker top and denim jacket pulled it all together. Breaking the embrace, the two women entered the restaurant, and with a reservation already set, they were seated quickly. The posh restaurant featured a number of accented walls, each with a grace and elegance that was not present the last time Karenna was here. Much of the construction equipment was gone, which started to worry Karenna. Maybe the bathrooms had been repaired? It certainly would put a damper on her fun. As she observed the new décor, Mary-Ann spoke first.

“Cassie really took to her training this week. I think she’s going to be great.”

“Yeah?” Karenna put bluntly “Good for her.”

“Do you have a problem with Cassie?”

“I know her type. None of those girls are as tough as they try to project. But what’s worse is that she’s arrogant. Maybe she will work out, I don’t know. But maybe I do have a bit of an issue with her.” Karenna squirmed in her seat

“Well, that’s a bit of a shame. Because she’s going to be working under you.”

“What?” Karenna was taken aback

“Yup. You want to be like me Kar, you’re going to have to learn how to teach.”

“Why can’t you just do it?”

“I can teach her plenty. But my time can be better used elsewhere. Can you at least be welcoming to her on Monday?”

“Sure boss. I’ll try.” Karenna was being honest. She’d try. But only because Mary-Ann asked her

The two were quiet for a moment. Mary-Ann sipped on her complimentary water. Karenna gulped hers down. The anticipation was killing her. Just tell me how and where we’re going to piss ourselves. You’re killing me boss! Me mind raced even as her body language stayed calm. The waitress came by with bread and to ask the pair if they were ready to order. Karenna took the opportunity to ask for a glass of wine.

“Woah! Starting a little early today, aren’t we Kar?” The waitress left to put their orders in

Karenna smiled her devilish smile “Well, yeah. And on top of the water I had on the way here. If I’m not careful I might just have a little accident.” If Mary-Ann wasn’t going to tell her, Karenna would prompt it out of her

“Hey, after that video you sent me, I doubt it’d be very ‘little!’ Still have to find a way to top you by the way.”

Karenna smiled, the two were enjoying their banter. “And with the bathroom’s being renovated here, who knows how big it might be!”

Mary-Ann’s smile disappeared. “The bathrooms are what?”

Karenna grew concerned “Didn’t you notice the work? When Nia and I had lunch here, they were being renovated. Out of order.”

Feeling a bit of fear, Mary-Ann replied “Oh. I-I had no idea.”

Karenna now felt uneasy “I thought it’s why you picked this place .”

“I honestly didn’t know that.”

“This is bad boss. I gotta pee. I thought you had something planned.”

“Planned for what?”

“I don’t know. Like maybe we’d let go in front of the bathroom doors, or-or right here?”

“Karenna! You know I couldn’t do that! Intentionally make a mess for others to clean, ruin someone else’s seat, and not to mention the fact that it’d be in the middle of a restaurant. Besides, I’m in white pants!”

“I wore my pink ones for a reason!”

There was a silence between the two. The waitress poured Karenna her glass of wine. After she left, Mary-Ann spoke

“Have…” She felt awkward asking the question, but she didn’t want Karenna to think she was mad at her. “Have you peed in them before?”

A sly smile appeared on Karenna’s face “Yup!” She was still a little miffed at her ruined fantasies

“Do they look good?”

Karenna nodded. She came back around, Mary-Ann knew how to get her talking again

“You know. I bought a mattress protector that other day.”

Mary-Ann raised and eyebrow. Karenna leaned in, her voice was in a low tone

“I have a feeling I might start having a little…uh bedwetting problem.” She smiled

“What does that feel like?” Mary-Ann was genuinely curious

“Well, cleanup sucks, but let me tell you. I’ve only done it once, but I can’t even begin to describe how naughty it feels. To just wake up in a puddle. Wet. But I really want to try just letting go right in the morning if I’m being honest. It’s just too comfortable.”

“I’ve always wanted to try that.”

“You should, boss! Just. Let me know how you like it.”

“I’m sure I will.”

The waitress came over with their lunch. Karenna stole a grab at her crotch. As she had planned, she was desperate. But now that it wasn’t the plan, she didn’t know what to do. But she thought she’d at least have some fun. She asked the waitress a leading question

“So are the bathrooms really still under construction.”

“Yeah.” She looked disappointed “They were supposed to be done two weeks ago, but a pipe burst.”

“Oh no!” Karenna didn’t care all that much. But she got butterflies in her stomach as she continued “But umm…What are we supposed to do if we have to pee?”

The waitress frowned “There isn’t much I can do for you, trust me. I’ve stopped drinking water on my shifts, but they’re still long. I’m sorry there really isn’t too many options.”

Karenna did feel a little sorry for the woman. She thanked her and went back to her meal with Mary-Ann, who asked a question

“Where did that boldness come from? You never used to say a word!”

“Well, I got used to our game. Plus Chloe likes it.”

“OoOoO, how is that going?”

“Eh” Karenna shrugged

“Eh? Why eh?”

“I don’t know. It’s just…” I really would rather be with you! Karenna thought, but she said something else “Something’s missing. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I think I had the best sex of my life with her. But…I feel like we just don’t click. Like I can’t be open with her.”

“How open do you want to be?”

Karenna sighed. She wouldn’t normally be this open in a friendship. To talk about her personal relationships like this. But this was Mary-Ann. Karenna felt like she could tell her anything.

“I want to share this.”

“What? This?” Mary-Ann motioned between the two women

“No. Not like our thing. I mean, yes our thing. But not with you as a part of it…unless you wanted to be.”

“No thanks. I like our thing between us. And really only us.”

“Not even with Tyler?”

“Well…not with anyone else just yet. It’d have to be someone I could trust.”

“It’s a big part of who I am now boss. I don’t really want to hide it.”

“Then tell her. You have my support.”

Karenna smiled. She still wished that she could lean in and kiss Mary-Ann, right now. Just being with her was intense for Karenna. She crossed her legs. Having a planned desperation was intense too, now that it wasn’t planned.

The rest of the meal was uneventful, the two talked some business, but even as they finished, Karenna had gone silent. Her desperation setting in. Under the table she had her hand gripping her crotch. Eagerly awaiting Mary-Ann to finish. She hadn’t touched her wine. Mary-Ann pointed to it

“Do you mind if I finish that?”

“Sure. You know why I order that, right?”

Mary-Ann winked as she took a drink “I have some idea.”

The two were silent again as Karenna nursed her filling bladder. Mary-Ann asked for the check. At least Karenna wasn’t in danger of a public wetting. At least, not one that wasn’t on her terms. When they had paid, the pair walked out of the expensive restaurant. The cold was the first thing Karenna noticed. And her bladder noticed it too

“Alright boss, thanks for lunch, but I wasn’t kidding. I have to piss.” Karenna visibly grabbed her crotch. She clenched her thighs together. Losing the tact of their usual banter, she bluntly asked Mary-Ann

“Can I just…right here?”

“Right in front of this place? I don’t think so. Can you make it like 500 yards?”

“Sure. I guess.”

Karenna followed Mary-Ann up the stairs, as she climbed, she could see the finished buildings, what were just shells when she and Nia desperately disrobed behind the dumpster. Mary-Ann spoke

“Whew…didn’t think that wine would hit so fast.”

“I…I did.” Karenna said sheepishly

Mary-Ann looked behind her, and smiled down at Karenna as she reached the top flight of the stairs. Her car was nearby. Karenna followed her to it, and her boss opened the driver side door and the passenger side door. Karenna knew why. She stood in between the open doors, bobbing her knees up and down.

“Look, I’m sorry I’m not…” She made a circular motion with her hand “…talking like I usually do. But I had a lot of water and some of that wine.” She was shuffling her feet “And I already had to pee before I got here.” She let go. The crotch of her pink jeans darkening “And I was trying to not pee in the restaurant, which I thought we might. And now I’m peeing. I’m-I’m peeing”

Mary-Ann watched as the thin dark streaks down Karenna’s thighs widened. Karenna kept shuffling her legs, her pee splashing out of the back of her jeans. They were thin, and most of her pee either splashed out onto the asphalt or it overran her now dark-pink thighs. Once it reached her kneecaps it mostly fell to the ground. But what made it though the backs of her legs made it all the way down to the ground. Her cuffs started to drip, and a puddle formed around her legs. As Karenna finished pissing herself, she looked up at Mary-Ann

“I had a lot to drink.”

Mary-Ann giggled “Yeah! I can see it running down your legs!”

“Well, you got a long ride home. And had plenty to drink. I’d better let you get going if you’re going to avoid doing this.” Karenna motioned to her wet self.

“Yeah. I honestly might have to pull over and find a restroom.” Her voice got higher pitched “I mean, I commend you for being so brave out here, but sometimes I like a bathroom.” Karenna could see a slow patch devolving on the crotch of Mary-Ann’s white pants “You know, the nice quiet. Just you and the toilet. And besides, if I wet my pants in public, we’d have people saying things like ‘Mary-Ann can’t hold it’”

Karenna pointed to the now see through crotch of Mary-Ann’s pants “I don’t think Mary-Ann can hold it!”

Putting her hands up to her mouth and feigning shock Mary-Ann factiously replied “Oh no! I guess you’re right. Just the though of making it, and running to the toilet, I must have figured I was already there!”

“I knew you wanted it, I knew it!”

“You just looked like you were having so much fun Kar!”

Karenna hugged Mary-Ann, even as her boss was still peeing her pants.

“Thanks for lunch boss. I always have fun with you.”

“Me too Kar, me too.”

I though you said this sub-chapter was going to have peeing? I'm not mad just a little disappointed, it was still an enjoyable read. I see Karenna is becoming more comfortable with the fetish and getting bolder. I'm interested to see how things with Karenna and Chloe will turn out and whether Chloe is interested in more than just a sexual relationship.

}}

I’m sorry about that, in my haste to post this chapter I forgot to tell you that I switched the order around to make the story flow better. The peeing scenes are now going to be 4.4 and 4.6. Sorry about that. But I’m happy you enjoyed the read!

They’ll be at least one to three peeing scenes per chapter, because personally, I like that aspect as much as the wetting. I totally get your disappointment though, that’s on me.

{{3 hours ago, PeeHour said:

Ok, definitely my new favorite part. Mary-Ann joining in at the end was the icing on the cake! I love the natural character progression and how it led up to this point. And seeing how much Karenna thoroughly enjoys it, plus her infatuation with her boss, is amazing. I'm looking forward to both the wettings and the story / character building. I'm rooting for Karenna and Mary-Ann to get 'closer,' or at least have a 'moment.' Overall, awesome chapter!!!

}}

I’m so glad this story keeps getting better and better for you and everyone else who is an avid reader! While you were reading towards the end, were you expecting Mary-Ann to join in at the end? Or was it a bit of a pleasant surprise? You’re comment got me thinking lol

We’re starting to build up a nice little story here between boss and protege. Maybe one day, Karenna will get her time with Mary-Ann…

Maybe she hasn’t gotten enough time yet, but do you think Chloe is a bit of a weak character, like there isn’t enough reason for Karenna to really be with her?

Maybe Chloe could be used as a plot device to make Mary-Ann jealous? Especially if Karenna gets Chloe to wet her pants with her and Mary-Anna gets envious since it's just a thing between her and Karenna? Of course the opposite can be true, if Mary-Ann introduces wetting to Tyler and then Karenna gets jealous and pulls some bolder moves. To go back to the original question though, it wouldn't be a huge loss to the story if Chloe ended up just being a fling.

Those are just ideas/predictions, I'll most likely enjoy wherever you decide to take this story!

}}

These are really interesting plot ideas! But I think I’ve got something up my sleeve that involves a lot of wetting, in a lot of different places. Can’t spoil it for now though!

*065*2021-11-23 10:23

A/N: This chapter was certainly a fun one to write for those who are keeping up with the story. And for those who just like peeing and wetting scenes, this chapter features a full slate of 3 wettings and 3 peeing scenes. As always, feedback is not only encouraged but appreciated. And that includes negative feedback! Also, at the end, I have some questions for our most avid readers, but I can’t put them here without spoilers.

Chapter 4.3: Telling Chloe

Karenna was already awake as her morning alarm rang. Today was the day. A week had nearly passed after Mary-Ann had told her to be open about her wants with Chloe. She had it all planned. By noontime she’d have her final bathroom break of the day. Then she’d head to Chloe’s after work. It was a date night after all, but Karenna wanted to ask Chloe is she could show her something. Then she would. As she reached over to her phone to shut the alarm off, her bed crinkled, the protective cover asking her if it would be used. Thinking about it for a moment, Karenna thought of the laundry. If all went well with Chloe, she wouldn’t even be home tonight. Leaving a stain for that long would be a nightmare. She decided against it. Promising herself that she’d find time again, Karenna stood up and stretched. She grabbed her phone off the night stand, the notification light still flashing. She had a text. It was from her boss.

Good luck! There was a video attachment

“Hey Kar, just got back from my morning run.” She was sweaty, and Karenna could swear she heard another sound. She couldn’t make out what it was though

“I know today is huge for you. And I want you to know that it takes a lot of courage to be as open with Chloe as you want to be. Let me know how it goes, and just know that I support you! Oh. And…” Mary-Ann panned the camera down. Her blue leggings had long dark streaks down each of her legs. That’s what the sound was. She had been peeing her pants while she talked.

“…I think I should have gone to the bathroom before I started this video.” She panned the camera back up.

This time Mary-Ann held her phone farther out, Karenna could see her a fuller shot of her boss. With her free hand, Mary-Ann cupped her crotch. She continued

“But I might be able to hold the rest in. Thanks for giving it a real try with Cassie. She just closed the Tomboli mortgage, that is a record for the first week.” Karenna could see another dark patch developing around Mary-Ann’s hand.

“You’ve been such a great employee and an even better friend. Just know I’ve always got your back.” She shook her hand, which was now drenched in pee.

“I’ve got some clean up here, but I’ll see you in a little bit.”

Karenna slipped off her panties and T-shirt. As she stepped over the sides of the tub, she flicked the handle to start the warm water. At first, the water spout for the tub gushed an ample amount of water onto her feet, but when Karenna flicked on the pin to activate the shower head, she synchronized the start of the shower head with the release of her morning pee. As she stood, she watched it sluice out of her black labia and splash onto the shower floor. The usual accompanying hiss was drowned out by the noise of the shower. Karenna put her hand over herself. The spray was felt all up and down her legs. She slipped a finger inside herself, her stream continuing over it. Today was supposed to be her big day with Chloe and all she could think about was her boss. Did Mary-Ann know what she did to Karenna with that clip? As Karenna stopped peeing and started masterbating, her mind was focused on the one thing it could never have. It wanted Mary-Ann.

Karenna was on all fours. The shower water ran over her back. Her orgasam had been intense, weakening her knees and robbing her of her breath. It was all about her boss. Not one part of her fantasy had involved her girlfriend. Karenna felt a wave of shame wash over her. She doubted herself. There was a hole in her heart that just big enough for one person. Every part of her told her that Chloe didn’t fit it. As Karenna finished preparing herself for her day, she was sure to bring a water bottle with her. She had a date tonight after all, and she’d stay committed to this one at least.

“Have a great day, sir!” Chloe smiled at the customer as he left.

There was a lull in the flow of business. The messy tables and pushed out chairs meant that despite the respite from orders and coffee machines, there was work to be done. Chloe’s coworker jumped into action with her. The two cleaned off the tables and pushed in the chairs as he spoke

“You’re unusually happy today. I thought you hated the morning shift?”

Chloe hummed to herself as she worked “I got a date tonight Jason!”

“Is she cute?”

“Like you wouldn’t believe! She’s just got so much energy, knows exactly what to say. I’m so ready to see her again!”

“Is this one serious?”

“I hope.”

Another customer came through the door. As Jason continued to clean, Chloe hopped back behind the counter. She took his order with the same glee she had been wearing all day. As she turned around to prepare his order, she took a sip from her bottle of water. Everything tasted better today. As the machine loudly made the customer’s drink Chloe could steal a minute to imagine herself and Karenna again. Her infatuation with the black woman’s body stole her mind. Chloe still couldn’t believe that a beautiful girl like that a alone in a club. That she wanted to be dominated the way she did. And that Chloe could deliver it. She almost felt bad, treating Karenna like that, but the way the woman moved and thrashed in bed was evidence enough that she wanted Chloe treat her like that.

As the customer got his order, Chloe wished him a good day. She let Jason clean as she daydreamed again. It had been a risk. At the end, to straddle Karenna and let go. But the fact that she had accepted it, even wanted it, served Chloe’s own fantasies.

“You going to do your job?” Jason was annoyed

“You’re just mad cuz no one likes you” Chloe got back to cleaning

“Wow. Harsh.”

“I am what I am.”

As Chloe worked her mind went back to her date. The little pictures they’d send back and forth, the videos Karenna sent her. To think that she picked out the one other girl in the world who was into the same things Chloe was. It set her heart aflutter. She hoped tonight would be another episode between the two, and took the feeling of her filling bladder as a good omen.

“You’re late.” Karenna scolded Cassie

“I know. I thought I’d take my time this morning”

“Did Mary-Ann know about this?”

“No. But I did close a record case in my first week, so…”

“So what?”

“…So I had some fun last night. This is the easiest paycheck in the world!”

“Here.” Karenna tossed two folders on Cassie’s desk. “Then these shouldn’t be too difficult for you.”

Cassie thumbed through the folders “A 195 and a 210? Isn’t this a little beneath me?”

“It’s your first week!”

“Yeah, but-“

“But what? I’m still ahead of you for the week- you’re not that special, and you’ll work on those files because I asked you to.”

Cassie rolled her eyes and put her headset on. Jealous bitch she cussed at Karenna in her mind.

Exasperated from her rebellious subordinate, Karenna sighed. Shaking her head, she sat back down at her desk. She took a drink from her water bottle. Not only was Cassie not cooperating, but neither was her bladder. Karenna didn’t feel a thing and she estimated that she was about half way through her bottle. She rubbed down the legs of her pants. They were the same pair of Khaki’s that she had first wet. In front of Sarah. She couldn’t help but feel aroused as she reminisced about her accident. The feeling of totally losing control. The encouragement by Mary-Ann in the elevator. 

The embarrassment of losing it all as it ran down her legs. Maybe one day she and Mary-Ann could re-enact it. No! No! Stop it. You’re supposed to feel that way about Chloe! The logical and moral part of her brain combined to scream at their master. Her heart protested. Mary-Ann was the woman Karenna wanted to be. Karenna felt safe, comfortable and happy when she was with Mary-Ann. Wasn’t that love? Then what’s Chloe? A whore? Someone to pleasure you? Shame flooded Karenna’s mind. And not the kind she liked. She put her head in her hands.

Cassie looked over at her superior. Karenna didn’t notice her, but Karenna looked defeated. While not making a conscious decision to do so, her aggressive mind saw an opportunity to prove its dominance over her hierarchical better. This primal need manifested itself in a simple ask.

“Can I go pee?”

Karenna looked up from her desk, her thoughts disturbed “You were and hour and a half late.”

“Uh, yeah, that’s why I have to pee.”

“Finish up a game plan for the 195, show it to me, then you can go.” Karenna took the tone of a school teacher

Karenna’s response kept the ball in her court, Cassie tried to wiggle out of the trap

“What if its kind of urgent?” Cassie was lying, but she needed to get out of Karenna’s verbal flank.

“You have a trash can.” Karenna expected this to shut Cassie down

Shrugging, Cassie pulled the waste basket over to her.

“Woah, woah, woah! Cassie, what the hell? I wasn’t serious.”

“Sounded like it to me.” Cassie didn’t care if it meant gaining leverage over Karenna

“Would Sarah let you act like that in her office?”

“Well…no.”

“Then why would I let you do that here?”

If you knew Mary-Ann, I bet she’d be cool with me being late. I shouldn’t have to take this from you. Cassie’s inner monologue lobbed venom at Karenna. Instead of words, she passively backed down. Karenna continued

“Show me how you’re going to close that mortgage and then you can go pee.”

Cassie nodded, Karenna had won this battle.

“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you this cheery, have I, Chloe?”

She smiled back at Jason, confirming her enthusiasm for her date with Karenna. But what he saw was her pee dance. The result of her morning hold and her anticipation of engaging in her secret spot.

“I-I think I’m going to take out the trash.”

Jason was on the drive thru headset, he nodded, unaware of why Chloe was so eager to volunteer. Gathering the trash from each of the smaller bins wasn’t difficult, but as Chloe bent over, her bladder sent shockwaves up and down her small frame. It wanted to release as much as she did. Though she was not at her limit, Chloe was desperate, and she crossed her legs as she bagged the trash. Smiling as she stood, she tossed the black plastic bag over her shoulder, and headed out the door.

It was a nice bright fall day. There was a nip in the air, but the heat of the sun felt good on Chloe’s back. She stayed close to the brick building, entering the shade as she turned the corner. The drive thru line was just a few cars deep, they were shielded by the 3 walls that surrounded the dumpster. Chloe opened the gate, a preventive measure against illegal dumping. She entered the enclosure and tossed the bag over her head into the awaiting dumpster. As she did so, her bladder spasmed. Chloe crossed her legs over each other and drove her hand into the crotch of her jeans. She felt a warm rush careen towards her opening. Holding this position, she clenched her muscles tight, and didn’t lose a drop. The feeling subsided, but her bladder was full. This was the game.

Chloe looked behind her. The gate and the walls obviously provided privacy, she knew that. But if she ever got caught in her little activity, she knew she’d be in serious trouble. Chloe unzipped her jeans, and undid the button. She backed towards the corner between the dumpster and the wall, shimming her jeans down to her ankles as she did. Her bare ass was now occupying a corner of the waste area. As Chloe set herself down into a squat, her bladder responded with another rush. This time, even if she had wanted to stop it, Chloe wouldn’t have been able to.

A yellowish liquid rocketed out of Chloe’s snatch. It felt warm as it sprayed the pavement below her. A splattering sound ensued as her urine hit the ground. The feeling and the nature of the act aroused Chloe. She closed her eyes as she listened to the sound. She enjoyed feeling the flow of her piss escape her pink skin. Chloe used her hands to reach under her arched legs, placing her palms on her ass cheeks, and grabbed her outer labia. As she spread herself with her hands, she entered back into her usual fantasy.

She had long pretended that her act was one of necessity, and not choice. In her mind she had, for so long, been the bursting employee. Sometimes she pretended she was the new girl, to shy to ask for a break, and now had to relieve herself in the corner. Or maybe it was the daytime rush that had held her up. An occupied bathroom. Whatever Chloe had wanted, she was the desperate employee, pissing in a corner. But now, as she squatted in the sun, her urine loudly spraying the ground; her fantasy had changed.

Now she imagined that she knew about this spot. That it was her secret place, as it was in real life. But this time, she met a desperate customer. The other woman would have come in off the road for a bathroom break, only to be greeted by an equally desperate Chloe. Then, out of a display of benevolence, Chloe would lead her to the secret spot, but only if she watched Chloe relive herself first.

Chloe opened her eyes again, her stream finally arcing back towards her, creating drips away from her puddle as it returned to its owner. She smiled. The woman in her new fantasy fit Karenna’s description. Chloe wondered if there would be an opportunity to tell Karenna to indulge with her soon. Chloe wiped herself with a thin napkin she had borrowed from the coffee shop. It hardly dried her, but she felt her fingers through the wet paper. Her long outer lips responded with sexual energy. She tossed the paper into her puddle, then took a moment to think as she pulled her jeans and panties back up. She could give Karenna a hint now. Snapping a picture of her deed, she sent Karenna a picture of the puddle, her discarded napkin in the center. She gave it a caption

New spot you’re going to try

Chloe smiled as she hit send. Karenna was her girl.

“Good job Cassie. Now what was so hard about that?”

“I think I’m qualified for the better stuff though. It’s a lot for just a 195.”

Karenna sighed the arrogance on this girl.

“Alright, you can go.”

“Home?”

“No. Didn’t you say that you had to pee and hour ago?”

“Oh, right. Thanks.” Cassie wheeled around, her black skirt whirled behind her.

At least Karenna’s bladder cooperating now. It was about noon, and time for it final proper emptying. It wasn’t full, but it’d be a break. As she watched Cassie travel down the hallway, her mind wondered. She stopped it. It wasn’t right to go there.

Cassie had just passed Anna’s desk when the tan skinned girl shot up from her chair

“Cassie, are you going to the bathroom?”

“Yeah, I was planni-“ Anna interrupted her

“Please, can I cut? I’m serious!”

Anna had been nothing but sweet to Cassie. She felt bad for the poor secretary.

“Go ahea-“ Anna interupted her, her hands pressed against. Her crotch

“Thanks so much!” She shouldered the door and rushed into the bathroom

What a strange place to work Cassie put her back against the wall, forming a line as Karenna filled in behind her

“Oh, so you’re following me now?”

“Even your boss has to pee Cassie.”

You’re not even my boss, you’re just in my way. I should make you piss yourself, I doubt you’d like that! Cassie kept her harshest words in her head. She wouldn’t really do that, but she knew she was better than Karenna. If only Mary-Ann could see it.

As Anna left the bathroom she kept her head down, her face red. Karenna leaned over to her as Cassie went in next

“Anna, are you ok?”

The nice girl nodded, but kept moving back to her desk. She obviously didn’t want to talk about it. Karenna changed the subject, hoping to distract the poor girl

“Is Mary-Ann in today? I could use her help with something.”

“Yeah! She’s just in her office!” Anna perked up

Karenna smiled back as she walked up to the heavy wooden door besides the conference room. She opened it carefully in case Mary-Ann was on a call. Her boss was free. Mary-Ann motioned for Karenna to come in.

“Big day today, huh Kar?”

“In more ways than one.”

“Oh?”

“Cassie was late. An hour and a half late.”

“Did she have a good reason?” Mary-Ann picked up a rubber band, playing with it in her hand

“No. She said she was up late partying. What do I do? Can I fire her?”

“Not unless I say so.” Mary-Ann seemed exasperated “It’s not like Sarah would text me back, I don’t know if she’s made a habit of this in the past. What did you do about it?”

“Well, nothing. I wanted to know what you would do.”

“Considering you were never late when you were in her position, I’ll leave it in your hands.”

“It’s like she just doesn’t respect me.”

Mary-Ann nodded. She swung her chair so that she could peer out the large windows. She thought for a moment.

“Maybe she needs a field trip. Some time with me. Let her know that I’m going to take her out to my properties in two weeks, I needed to see Donovan anyway.”

Karenna nodded. She started to back out the door

“Oh, and Kar?”

Karenna turned. Mary-Ann was still staring out the window

“You prepping for your big night?”

Karenna smiled her coy smile “You know it boss. I’ve actually got to go right now.” Karenna kept her smile “You?”

“Badly. Don’t even know if I’ll make it home.”

Karenna exited Mary-Ann’s office, horny. Her desire for a night with her boss ravaged though her sensitive parts. She turned right, and headed towards the restroom, her hips swaying with the buzz of sexual energy she got from Mary-Ann.

Pushing open the bathroom door, Karenna took out her phone as she entered the single stall. Her phone had received a text from Chloe a while ago. Karenna pulled down her work pants and panties as she read the text. She let go of her last proper pee while she looked at Chloe’s deed. The puddle on the ground in her lovers photo was obvious, and as Karenna’s own piss sprayed the inside of the toilet, she propped herself up. She took a picture of her clear pee stream. Giving it the caption

You want me to do this?

A text came back quickly, though the hiss of Karenna’s deflating bladder drowned out the notification. Karenna read it, even as the spray tickled the inside of her labia

Good girls do what they’re told

Karenna let it sit and instead focused on emptying her bladder into the office toilet. It was a pleasant time to be alone, the troubles and the burgeoning feud with Cassie draining away as she drained herself into the porcelain. Mary-Ann had said something about the calmness of using the toilet. And though Mary-Ann was pissing her pants in front of Karenna at the time she made the quote, as Karenna wiped herself, she actually agreed. She sat for a minute. She looked back at her phone. Trying to remember her date and forget about her feelings for Mary-Ann. A naughty idea crossed her mind. Standing from the toilet, she flushed and walked in front of the mirror. She had just a little left. She let go.

If Mary-Ann caught her doing this, she would be reprimanded on the spot. A quick jet of pee warmed her panties as it escaped. Karenna, aware of her actions, gasped as a small dark patch, no larger than a quarter, appeared on her crotch. Technically, she had just wet her pants in the office. She took a mirror selfie to send to Chloe.

With a caption that proved it wasn’t a shadow, Karenna poked at what she was going to do with Chloe.

But what if I showed up like this

She got a text back

Tonight?

It’s a long drive

Bad girls get punished.

Karenna smiled, she was starting to anticipate her evening with Chloe. Her mind recalled the awesome sex they had, and despite her other desires, more of that sex was certainly welcome. Karenna headed back to her desk. Her heart pounded as she walked by Anna’s desk. The wonderful girl was too busy working to notice. Mary-Ann was still in her office. Karenna walked to her own corner, Cassie was texting. Karenna decided to flaunt her daring move. She leaned against her desk, which was right near Cassie’s, and got the young miscreant’s attention.

Cassie looked up from her phone. Her eyes immediately noticed a dark patch on Karenna’s light khakis. Did she? Karenna shifted as she started to talk

“Clear your calendar in two weeks. Mary-Ann is going to take you on a little field trip”

That has to be…this chick just pissed herself Cassie couldn’t stop staring. Her eyes were transfixed. It took everything she had to not say a word. Bitch wants to tell me what to do and can’t even wait in a bathroom line? Her mind raced as she thought that Karenna may have a bladder problem. Or that she didn’t believe in toilet paper. In any case, how on earth was Cassie below her on the totem pole? She still hadn’t responded to Karenna’s statement

“Will you at least do that Cassie?

“Sure, sure. I’ll go on Mary-Ann’s field trip.”

At least she doesn’t piss her pants Cassie mocked Karenna, in her mind

Karenna looked at her crotch under her desk. Her stain had disappeared, returning to the normal khaki color of the pants she was wearing. If one looked close enough, they would only see the slight discoloration. Karenna hoped the only one looking would be Chloe in about an hour. The afternoon had not been nearly as eventful, and the only thing that had stood in Karenna’s way as she finished two waters and soda were emails and calls. But those beverages ha made their way into Karenna’s bladder. And they didn’t care that she was holding it on purpose. They wanted to be relieved. And they wanted it now. Karenna wiggled as she kept a watchful eye on Cassie. She hoped her rebellious understudy wouldn’t use her forced hold against her.

Karenna stood, her workday done. But as she did so she winced. The pain that emanated from her bladder sent signals to their rest of her muscles to hold on. As they did, Karenna crossed her legs. She stood on one as she wrapped the other around it. Gingerly walking to Cassie’s desk, she leaned against her own. She tapped her heels in a bid to continue her desperation discretely.

“So I want you here until 7, Cassie.”

“7?! But-“

“But you were here late. So you stay late.” Karenna clenched her thighs

“Fine. I guess.”

Cassie wasn’t intimidated Or what? You’ll piss your pants again? Cassie noticed Karenna holding herself as the two parted. Does she seriously need to pee again? The fuck is wrong with her?

The drive to Chloe’s was painful. No matter what Karenna did, she couldn’t make her hold enjoyable. As she drove and weaved through traffic, she clenched her thighs together. At a red light, she would dig her hand into her crotch. If this had been a hold for fun, she would have already wet her pants. But she wanted to show Chloe, and though her hold wasn’t fun, it was the possibility of her wetting leading to sex. That made it fun enough. She shifted her weight to one side as she made her way downtown, past the club where they met. She was close, but the heavy feeling in her bladder told her that she was running out of time.

She swung into a free parking space. One of the only free spots at Chloe’s apartment complex. Karenna ripped her keys out of the ignition, and furiously opened her door. She put her keychain on top of the car after stepping outside as she reached back inside for her purse. Each movement was a strain on her bladder, but her grip held. She hadn’t played with it today, and her newfound strength to from her frequent holds was showing. That didn’t mean that she could stand up fully though. She was full, enough to arch herself forward. Her legs shook uncontrollably, begging her to just let go. Karenna was close to her goal.

Wobbling her way towards Chloe’s brick apartment building, another tenant noticed her predicament. She was another black woman

“Me too girl!” She shouted across the parking lot

“I’m seriously about to pee myself!” Karenna called back.

Maybe it was an exaggeration for others, but right now, Karenna was being honest. She reached the awing, breathing heavily the whole way. She was too desperate to think of what to say to her lover. She got inside, the overly hot building casing its warmth over her. She fumbled herself to apartment number 3. Karenna knocked. She marched in place, trying to hold as much of her pee as she could. She stopped. Held herself. She knocked again. Nothing. She was in a partial crouch as two teenagers walked by. As the left the building, she heard one of the whisper to the other

“She’s gotta pee!”

Karenna turned back around and slapped the door with her bare palm.

“Chloe, I’m here…please”

Her phone vibrated

What’s the magic phrase?

“Please?” Karenna asked the door

Tell me how bad it is. Her phone buzzed again

“Chloe, if you don’t let me in right now, I’m going to piss on the floor out here. Please let me in!”

The door unlocked, Chloe poked her head out slowly. Doing anything slow was not in Karenna’s purview now. She nearly pushed Chloe back into the apartment as she put her things down on the small wooden table. She turned around, still half hunched, evidence of her swollen bladder.

“Sounds like my little K has to take a big piss.”

“Chloe, I‘ll be level with you. I wanted this to be romantic and it is something I’ve never had to bring up before, but I can’t wait much longer.” Karenna spoke fast.

But she paused, hoping to pick the right words. But they left her mouth before she could even process them

“I really like to pee my pants for fun, and I’m so desperate now. Can I please do it for you?”

Chloe’s lips contorted. She mulled it over. Karenna bounced, wiggled and stood there, waiting for an answer. Was Chloe’s delaying her answer on purpose? If she took too long, Karenna was going to have to do it anyway. Chloe spoke

“Move your hands” They were hovering in front of Karenna’s crotch

Karenna obeyed, moving them away to her sides

“Stand straight up”

Karenna obeyed, her bladder stretching, yelling, screaming and complaining at her. Tears formed from the pain

“Pee your pants”

Karenna obeyed. She felt her moistening panties dampen as the first gush of warm piss sprayed out of her private parts. It wasn’t long before she could feel her pants warm too. A torrent of hot urine ran down her legs.

Chloe watched intently as the first patch began to show on her lover’s crotch. It broke into thick, dark streaks as it rushed down her khakis. Each of her pant legs became just as dark, but they overflowed, and soon her floor was splattering with Karenna;s urine. It dripped off of her back legs, and rushed down to her cuffs. As it dripped off of them, the overflow filled Karenna’s heels. A rapidly growing puddle and formed as all of Karenna’s full bladder emptied into her pants. Chloe was enraptured by it.

Karenna could feel her bladder nearly empty. She sighed. It wasn’t the same as it was with Mary-Ann. She needed another girl with her. She opened her eyes again, and lowered her head to look Chloe in the eye

“You too?”

Chloe was busy staring at Karenna’s spectacle. She looked up.

“I guess I had that extra water today…ok, I’ll try it.”

Karenna smiled. Chloe reached out her hand

“Your pants please”

“W-what?”

“Yup, I’m going to try it.”

“But don’t you have your own? Besides, I’m still peeing”

It was true. While it wasn’t much, Karenna was still dribbling into her blue panties

“Yeah, but I like these pants, and you obviously don’t care about yours, so…Pants please.”

They did hold value for Karenna though. These were the first pair that she wet. She felt like they helped her discover herself, along with Mary-Ann. But maybe this meant that they were going to give her another new beginning? She shimmied them off, now finished peeing. She handed them to Chloe, who put them on

“It’s so cold!” Chloe squirmed as she fit them over her legs

“Warm them up then!” Karenna tried to banter like she did with Mary-Ann

“I’ll try…” Chloe closed her eyes

Karenna stared at her lover, her own blue panties now exposed, as the puddle she had made was also cold. Chloe gasped

“Oh my God, its so warm.”

“Are you peeing?” Karenna felt some joy

Chloe nodded, her face told Karenna that she didn’t know what to make of it. Karenna wasn’t even sure Chloe was telling the truth. It was silent, and impossible to tell on the already wet fabric. It soon became clear that Chloe was being honest as a new puddle began to grow at her feet. It wet Chloe’s socks as it formed. But it stopped quickly, Chloe hadn’t been desperate.

“So…how was it?” Karenna was inquisitive

“I’ll be honest. I loved it on you. You’re so adorable when you can’t hold it anymore.”

Chloe moved closer.

“But how am I supposed to punish you for being a pants wetter, when I’m doing the same thing, hmm?”

She grinded on Karenna.

“And speaking of which, I just saw you piss yourself. Do you know what I’m going to do to you for that?”

“I want to find out”

Karenna followed Chloe to her bed, and the two trashed and mangled their bodies together. Karenna’s fears, and thoughts from the day evaporated into lust. She was primal, in that moment. Once the two had calmed down, Chloe looked over at her partner. Karenna was flat on her back.

“You were mad today, weren’t you?”

“How could you tell?”

“You didn’t need any instructions for the way you used that tongue this time. You’re a good girl.”

Karenna smiled, taking the compliment and enjoying the pillow talk. She could still taste Chloe on her lips. Chloe propped herself up on her elbow, facing Karenna, their nude bodies nearly exposed by the light sheet. Karenna felt a hand on her leg as she bent her legs. Her black pussy was exposed. The hand crept closer towards her.

“What’s one of your fantasies K?”

“I don’t know if I’m ready to share.”

“Not even if we trade? It doesn’t have to be your biggest one.”

The hand was on her inner thigh. Karenna could feel Chloe’s fingers near her snatch. She looked over at her partner

“You first.”

Chloe was forthright. She told Karenna about the desperate customer she wanted to come into the store, and that the two might share in her little spot. Her fingers massaged Karenna’s pussy. It was wet again as Karenna liked the idea. Chloe kissed her. As they broke the kiss, Chloe whispered

“Now you, tell me what K wants.”

Karenna looked her in the eyes. Her genitals were still being skillfully manipulated by Chloe. She gave it up. But not her biggest fantasy

“I want to pee my pants in public.”

Chloe slipped another finger in, Karenna was wet, ready for round two.

“What would that do for you K?”

“The shame. Knowing that I can’t hold it anymore and that everyone can see me. It turns me on.”

“I can tell.”

Chloe rolled on top of her. Karenna wasn’t sure how or when the two might act on their fantasies, or if she’d even be with Chloe long enough to get there. But damn if the sex wasn’t good.

A/N: I would love to know your thoughts on a few things. First, do you like the rivalry between Cassie and Karenna? Does it seem natural and where do you see it going? Also, this is the first time we got Chloe’s perspective on anything. Does it change your thoughts about her, or her and Karenna’s relationship? And lastly, I felt like I rushed Karenna’s last desperation scene, what do you think?

{{4 hours ago, LifeIsStrange said:

Seems natural to me and it makes me excited to see where things go next, last scene didn't feel rushed to me and I do like the rivalry.

}}

That great to hear, didn’t want the two to feel like they were rivals just because I as the author wanted them to be that way.

{{56 minutes ago, orangelion said:

The rivalry between Cassie and Karenna did feel natural, but I think Cassie's inner thoughts on Karenna were too harsh for someone she hardly knows. I initially though that Chloe was just interested in a sexual relationship, but her telling Justin that she hopes this relationship is serious proves she is interested in a romantic relationship. Her wetting for Karenna also means she is willing to try new things for her. Maybe their relationship will work out? Lastly, the last desperation scene was shorter than usual, but it didn't feel rushed at all.

}}

I really enjoyed reading your breakdown, and your right, I can can see that I wrote Cassie to be a little too harsh. I was aiming for tough, over confidence and forgot that this is basically their first scene together.

With Karenna’s relationship, and Chloe’s desire for something more substantial, does it make Karenna the bad guy if she’s not committed either and is more or less just there for the sex?

{{2 hours ago, PeeHour said:

Another good part! No one mentioned it yet, but I like how Karenna pushed the boundaries of "no playing at work" by intentionally leaking. I wonder if Cassie will tattle? And I wonder if this isn't the first time the rules will be broken again?

}}

Do you think Cassie would do that to Karenna? If the rules were broken again?

{{2 hours ago, PeeHour said:

I don't think it quite makes her the bad guy. The audience knows she is truly enamored by her boss, so it does create some conflict, but her leading on Chloe due to unresolved feelings for someone else is something relatable enough (for some) without being too 'evil.' Especially in this situation where her crush is essentially unobtainable, so it makes sense to try and force feelings for someone else. And adding in the omorashi layer makes it even more complicated, but interesting for the readers!

}}

I’m glad I’m striking that balance right for you guys, because part of me feels like the center of this chapter was too heavy on story. I’m trying to make sure we get enough pee/omo content in each story.

{{2 hours ago, orangelion said:

I agree with @PeeHour, I don't think Karenna is a bad guy. She clearly feels guilty about thinking about Mary-Ann instead of Chloe and is trying to make things work out with Chloe instead of purely using her for sex.

}}

That’s good to know, because that was intent with this part of the story. I don’t want any of the main girls to be overbearing, annoying, or at worse not fun to interact with

*072*2021-11-24 15:07

{{6 hours ago, arg08 said:

I think Cassie is bordering on being annoying, but I have faith that you made her this way for a reason - that she's leading up to a "bad girl made good" storyline, or going the other way turning into a villain that we will love to hate, or some other twist I haven't thought of.

Is the worst part about her that she’s too rough? Or is there another character trait that she has that’s annoying? She is going to be a central character and I’d rather not have a jar-jar binks type

Hmm! It was just a feeling, but now you're making me analyse it....

I think it's because she's being rude and disrespectful to the other characters (who we've already come to know and like), but without any purpose: it's not because she's engaged in some evil plot, she's not a total slacker who never does any work for anybody, she's not doing it because she's ultra-competitive, maybe she thinks she's better than Karenna but if so we've not been given any reason why she should think that way; conversely she's not resenting others for being better than her. Essentially she's just got this nasty attitude and no reason for it.

But as I say, it's early days and the reason may become clear - or her attitude may soften and she comes to respect the others (or she gets fired...). Or maybe I'm grumbling over nothing and the story needs an annoying character for contrast with the likeable ones.

Certainly trust your own judgement over mine - I wouldn't have dreamed of commenting if you hadn't asked the question!

This is valuable feedback! I can totally see where your coming from, and I’ll have to keep that in mind going forward. She gets her own scene with Mary-Ann on Friday, so hopefully with some more development as to why she has a bad attitude, it’ll be a little more clear.

I’m glad the others are liked though, even though it feels more like Karenna’s story at this point than Mary-Ann’s. Or maybe its both of theirs lol

A/N: First off, with the holiday here in the US, I wanted to wish you a safe and happy time. Wherever you’re from! This time around we have more character development with Cassie. I hope this helps add some depth and reasoning behind her aggression. We’re still just kicking off her story arc, so hopefully she’ll grow on you. I felt like some of the descriptions were lacking here. Let me know how the scene worked for you in this one. As always, feedback is not only encouraged but appreciated! Good feedback makes a great story. Let me know if Cassie improved as a character here too

4.4: Cassie’s second lesson

Cassie pulled her long black dress boots over her feet. It was an early morning for her, but it was not an appointment she would miss. She did her lipstick. Her hair was dried, twirled and set at her shoulder length. She stared at the girl in the mirror. Her breasts were too small, and her nose ring was tacky. Cassie knew no one wanted her. But she put on a face, her professional bra and blouse masked her naked self. She pulled her black pencil skirt up, and sighed. She hated the woman in the mirror.

Flushing the toilet, she cleared it of her morning pee. She grabbed a black coffee for breakfast as she walked by the kitchen. The concrete steps scraped her new boots. It was early enough to still be dark as she sat in her car. She didn’t have to go. She could just not show up. Go have fun somewhere else. You don’t deserve this anyway. You had one. Just one good one. A flash in the pan. Don’t waste Mary-Ann’s time the way you wasted Sarah’s. She hesitated in starting her car. She remembered what Mary-Ann had asked her. What lesson had she learned. Mercy. Have mercy on her time, Cassie. At least pretend to learn something. Convincing herself to go to work, Cassie started her car.

“No. I’m not firing her Kar.” Mary-Ann waded her way through traffic. Her commute was longer than before

“She hasn’t closed anything in two weeks. She’s been late. And she’s always making these remarks at me.”

“Is it the production or the relationship that bothers you?”

There was a silence

“The relationship”

“So you want to be liked or be a leader?”

“Liked, I guess.”

“Karenna, what you and I have is very special, you know that.”

Karenna’s heart rate increased. Mary-Ann didn’t know how special it was to her. All of it. Mary-Ann was still talking

“What’s even more special is that you’re genuinely my best friend. You know that. But its not the case for many leaders.”

Karenna understood

“Stop asking her to like you and try to ask her to produce for you.”

“But she’s not producing either.”

“She closed the biggest mortgage for a rookie in her first week. She gets a grace period.”

“How long?”

“I guess that depends on today. If she’s a malcontent with me, I guess it’s probably unsalvageable. Let me spend some time with her at least.”

“Fine.” Karenna wasn’t happy about her boss’s commitment to Cassie

“You and Anna holding down the fort today?”

“Yeah. Lot of calls for me, I don’t really need her. Can I give her the day off?”

“I need her to keep me updated, and I doubt you want the spam calls going to you. She does a lot, trust me, you’ll want her around. Feels good to be in charge though?”

“In charge? Does that mean I can undo some of your rules?”

“Which one?” Mary-Ann knew. But she could see the office from where she was. Some fun banter would be a nice start to her day

“A girl can get really desperate on some of these longer calls. And, I don’t know if you know, but. I pee my pants sometimes.”

Mary-Ann feigned shock by giving a fake gasp “You? I have a hard time believing that Ms.Karenna Bryant has ever wet her pants.”

“Mhmm, its true. Might have even happened this week. And the week before that. And I’ve heard you’ve got a strict rule against that in the office. But if I’m in charge, I can revise that, right?’’

“C’mon Kar, I think you can hold it. Besides, that rule is a strict one. Don’t cross it!”

“I know boss, but I had to ask.”

“Hey speaking of which, you made your target for the year Kar. I think I owe you that girls trip.”

Karenna squealed. She knew Mary-Ann would honor her promise

“Name the place you want to go to, and I’ll cover it. And I’ll be sure to bring some extra clothes.” She paused for a moment “Never know what might happen.” Mary-Ann teased

“I’m so looking forward to it. Love you boss!”

“Love you too Kar.” Mary-Ann meant it platonically, Karenna did not.

After the two hung up, Mary-Ann turned off her SUV. She had made it to the office during her conversation with Karenna. She stepped out of the car. Mary-Ann was a little early, but she hoped Cassie would be there on time.

As Mary-Ann waited outside her car, Anna walked by on her way to work. The two smiled at each other. Though Anna and Mary-Ann hardly talked outside of work, Mary-Ann could appreciate her work. Karenna was the next to run by. Her heels clicked as she ran.

“Can’t talk boss, not going to make it if I do.”

Mary-Ann smiled at the show, but she wasn’t sure if Karenna’s desperation was real. Mary-Ann looked at her watch. Cassie had just a few minutes, and Karenna’s show had reminded Mary-Ann that she should use the bathroom before heading out.

Mary-Ann started to leave her post when a car came racing into the garage. It sped around a corner and parked close. It was Cassie. She walked up to Mary-Ann’s car as she downed the last of her coffee. Mary-Ann asked her if she was ready. Cassie nodded and the two climbed into Mary-Ann’s SUV. Forgoing her bathroom trip, Mary-Ann figured she’d be ok. Or she’d at least have a fun little hold at the end of the day.

“So where are we headed?” Cassie asked as she got into Mary-Ann’s car

“I’ve got a property up in the sticks- I check in on it once a quarter.” Mary-Ann got in the the car and started it

“Isn’t that why you pay a property manager?”

“Yes, for the day to day. But what kind of owner would I be if I never gave my tenets a chance to see me?”

Mary-Ann started to back out of the parking lot. Cassie seemed a little worried

“W-wait…ah, never mind” Cassie felt her bladder. Her morning coffee already aggravating it

“Are you sure?”

“I’m fine.” Cassie looked at Mary-Ann “I don’t want to make you late.”

Cassie seemed awfully timid for the way Karenna described her. Mary-Ann wondered if the girl was intimidated by her. The two were silent for a while. Both of their bladders were filling- though it bothered neither of them. After they got on the highway, Cassie asked something that had been bothering her

“So are you and Sarah still tight or…”

“No.”

“Then why’d you take me?”

“Are you Sarah?”

“No, but she recommended me, didn’t she?”

“Sort of. She mentioned you. Your success- your…issues.”

“And you took me?”

“I offered you a job. If you can sell, you have a future in this line of work.” The two passed the last rest stop before exiting onto a two lane route. There was nothing on either side but trees and fields.

“Are you sure?” Cassie shifted in her seat, her bladder starting to become uncomfortable

“That it takes selling skills to succeed in this business? Or if you have the talent?”

“If I have the talent.”

“Your talent is not the question Cassie. You made eight grand in your first week.”

“And what after that?”

“So you hit a slump. Happens to all of us.”

“I think Karenna is trying to keep me there.”

Mary-Ann let the statement hang. Her own need was starting to bother her

“Why?”

“She’s so cold. I know she hates me. I don’t know why.”

“Are you sure about that?”

“I can feel it.”

“And it’s not because you made an off-color remark at lunch?”

“If its about that, she’s kind of petty.”

“Maybe. But then you were late, and she said you always have a ton of remarks.”

“I-its just the way I am…unfortunately.”

“She might think you hate her.”

“She has every right to. I…I’ll be honest. I don’t belong here.” Cassie’s bladder felt heavier

“Why would you say that?”

“I don’t know.” She paused, shifting her weight around, attempting to ease some pressure. “Maybe. Can she just tell me that I did a good job once in a while?”

“Have you asked her?”

“No. You don’t ask for complements. I’m no bitch.”

Mary-Ann laughed at the sudden cuss. “You’re right. Well how about this- you’ve got potential kid, but lose the tough girl act. And focus on production, even if you don’t like Karenna. Your job might depend on it.”

Mary-Ann comforted Cassie by warmly patting her leg. Each smack sent more signals to Cassie that she needed to ask for a break. But she was more perplexed by Mary-Ann encouragement. I don’t know how you tricked her. But maybe do what she says, Cassie. Trust her. She tried to encourage herself. She exhaled as they made their way off of the rural highway. She shifted her weight and put her hand over herself. Cassie hoped she could relive herself at some point.

Mary-Ann was surprised at how full she felt. It wasn’t anything she couldn’t handle, but as they drove through the small rural town, she knew she’d be in it for the long haul back to the office. The two were silent as they exited. Neither were aware of the others growing condition, but as Cassie’s boots touched the muddy ground, she swore. First time wearing these boots and they all ready needed work. She bent over to rub some of the mud off, and as she did, a rush of liquid ran down to her privates. She rubbed the mud off, but as she stood, she wiggled her legs. Confidently, she regained control. Maybe I can ask one of these people if I can use their bathroom. Cassie looked around the lot. There was just the road they came in on, and the hill across the way. For that matter, I could squat around the corner.

The two women with filling bladders met at the nose of the SUV. Cassie held her black notepad at her side, and Mary-Ann, in her beige pencil skirt, walked in front of her. The mud and her need to pee had Cassie wobbling from foot to foot, her weight from hip to hip. Mary-Ann had clenched her muscles, her strong bladder retaining its liquid while not forcing Mary-Ann to quiver in the same way Cassie was. A portly man with graying hair and a mustache greeted the two women, who were gradually getting desperate.

“Ms.Mary-Ann, how are you?” He reached out his hand

She greeted him warmly and introduced Cassie. The young professional clutched her notebook and her tight abdomen reminded her that the coffee she had was ready to be excreted.

“Donovan, I thought I asked you to take these signs down” Mary-Ann motioned to the yard signs.

“And I told you it was a mistake. Look, ask the guy if you want, but I promise you its a mistake.”

Neither of them noticed Cassie crossing her legs behind them.

“Fine, I have to do a run through anyway. The AC system you fixed last time?”

“Here, I’ll show you.” Donovan led the tight walking Mary-Ann and the nearly goose-steeping Cassie. Her need was growing.

Cassie was relieved as Donovan showed them around the corner of the complex. There was just an open field towards the road, with a tree line partially obstructing the view. She could squat around this corner if she could get the two of them to leave her alone. Donovan had the two sharply dressed women gathered around the AC unit. Cassie’s legs wiggled as though she was cold. Donovan didn’t notice her as he prattled on about the makeshift work had had done, and how thankful he was that Mary-Ann had taught him more about the internet. Or something along those lines, but Cassie wasn’t really paying attention, she held her black notepad in front of her knocking knees, trying to come up with an excuse to use the AC unit as cover. He addressed Cassie

“Are you from upstate?”

She gave him a look. Crossed her legs. Cassie was unaware that Mary-Ann was starting to do the same

“No?”

“Oh. You look like someone my daughter goes to college with. There goes that segue.”

“What segue?”

“Well, May-Ann, the property managers conference upstate is in need of a speaker. We tried to get Steven Warner, and he recommended you. It’s a one day event, but I can pay for your hotel if need be.”

“I’ll check with Anna. But put me down as a yes for now.”

“Great! Might be a learning experience for Ms.Cassie, you want me to get a room for the both of you?”

He had accidentally backed Mary-Ann into a yes. The nice balding man still didn’t seem to notice Cassie rocking up and down. Her desperation was growing quickly. Perhaps it was because Mary-Ann was still so composed. But she felt the same tingle in her womanhood that she always did when she needed to pee. And her crossed legs were evidence of that.

Mary-Ann asked Donovan if she could get access to the complex and knock on the doors. As Donovan gave her the ok, Cassie took her opportunity at relief. She waited for the man to walk by her, and for Mary-Ann to follow him. She lied to them.

“My dad work on these all the time. I’ll be up there in a second- let me take a selfie.”

Mary-Ann rolled her eyes, though she wasn’t too cross. As they rounded the corner Donovan asked

“A self what?”

Cassie wasted no time in putting her notepad on top of the AC unit. She slightly bent her knees, as the unit came up to her waist. With one hand, she pulled her panties to the side. With her free hand, she spread her labia. With her mind, she released the hold she had on her bladder. A warm rush shot towards her spread lips, her pierced labia was no stranger to getting bathed in her urine. It was always a rush for her, to pee outside. And she enjoyed the first few seconds of relief.

“Cassie? You coming?”

Shit. Shit. Shit. Cassie slipped her fingers off of herself and slid her panties back into place. She put her hands on top of the AC unit. Her panties were starting to get warm as her stream renewed.

“U…uh…uh y-y-yeah. J-just wait-waiting on the text back.” It was starting to flow down her legs

“I don’t have time for that, c’mon”

Cassie didn’t respond as she clutched her womanhood hard. Stop peeing. Stop, stop, don’t ruin your clothes, stop peeing! It was only a few more seconds, but the damage had been done. Cassie pulled her black panties away from herself. The dark fabric covered her large leak, but the fabric was soaked.

“Fuck!” Cassie exclaimed as she shook pee off of her hand

As she tried to compose herself, another jet of pee warmed her panties. A streak of pee ran down her leg again. She was able to hold on, and for now, her need sharply decreased. Sighing, she started to walk towards Mary-Ann. Her foot was warm, it felt clammy as her pee had traveled inside. Nice job, ruined your boots. Hold the rest you failure.

Mary-Ann exhaled as she crossed her legs. She bent forward, Donovan gave her a look.

“Heels”

He bought it. Cassie came around the corner, she was walking stiffly.

“You ok Cassie?” Mary-Ann asked

“Fine. What do you need from me here.”

“I want you make note of anything that needs to be repaired or might be out of order.”

Cassie nodded as Mary-Ann knocked on the door. Cassie’s bladder was numb. She was confident that even though one of her boots was squelching from her incident, it had ultimately helped her. She’d make it back to the office. Mary-Ann wasn’t so sure she’d be able to make it all the way. It would be a close one. She clutched the hem of her skirt, attempting to stay in control. An old Man answered the door.

“Mr.Rose, I’m Mary-Ann, your landlord. I wanted to introduce myself.”

“Ok. Well thank you, but Jeopardy is on.”

“Those are your signs in the yard, yes?”

“Yeah.”

“Could you take them down please? We don’t allow political signs.”

“I told you last time. It’s not political. Guy was murdered.”

“And I asked you to take them down last time. Mr.Rose please.” Mary-Ann’s legs were shaking

Cassie, felt a sharp pain, her bladder aggravated. She needed to get into this place and use the bathroom. She spoke up. Her kneecaps touching from her rapidly approaching desperation

“Look, she asked you twice now. Do what she says.”

“Get a lawyer. I won’t do it.” The man shut the door

“Good job tough girl.” Mary-Ann gave her some sarcasm.

The two knocked on the next door. No one was home. The two women stood on the porch, their knees wiggling. Mary-Ann prepared to leave.

“You’re doing great work Donovan, place looks good. I’ve got another project coming up, I’ll put you on.”

The two shook hands, Cassie crossed her legs. Any longer and she might be waddling back to the car. She walked slowly behind Mary-Ann, and back to the car. The two were quiet as they entered the SUV. Cassie asked a legitimate question

“Was that a good use of time?”

“Did you learn something?”

“Maybe.”

“Cassie, I would have made this trip anyway. But I was hoping to get to know you a little better. I’m sorry I couldn’t teach you anything this time around.”

“I mean, it’s not big, but I learned that I was being to harsh with Karenna. It’s my, fault, it’s m-me.” Cassie squeezed herself. She needed to pee

“Mercy, Cassie, you should have granted Karenna some space. But, produce for her, and you’ll do fine.” Mary-Ann looked at Cassie and smiled. The tough girl smiled through her pain, her bladder was filled.

The two were quiet as they started to leave town. Cassie broke rank

“Do you need to stop off and get some gas?”

“No, we’re fine.”

“Can we stop anyway…I need to go to the bathroom.”

“You don’t want to stop there. Donovan told me last time, there’s some kind of pervert around here.” Mary-Ann waited “There’s a rest area just as soon as we get back on the main highway. Can it wait?”

Cassie nodded, unsure. To Mary-Ann’s credit, she was a lot more gentle than Sarah. Especially when it came to Cassie needing to use the bathroom. But as they passed back through the downtown, Cassie was holding herself hard. Her wet panties had cooled and were now moist. They begged to be wet again. Though it would be against her will. She wanted to hold it. But she shifted in her seat again, wondering if she could. Her bladder was full, it pushed against her walls. 

She had promised it relief, and even given it some. It wanted more, and whether it was all over Mary-Ann’s seat or somewhere else, it did not care. Legs shaking, bladder filled, Cassie was still quiet. Her silence created an awkward atmosphere in the car. They got back on the rural highway. Just outside Cassie’s door were trees. They flew by with the speed of the car, not caring how rapidly Cassie’s boots were tapping the car floor. Cassie needed to piss, badly. Maybe Mary-Ann really was different than Sarah. She dared ask a question she would have never asked a few months ago.

“M-Mary-Ann? I…I’m not going to make it. Could you p-pull over.” She paused, clenching her muscles tight “I’d like to use the-the woods”

Without saying a word, Mary-Ann put the hazard lights on and slowed the SUV. She unlocked the doors from her side. And motioned for Cassie to get out. As she exited, Cassie told her

“I’ve got to piss so bad!”

Cassie duck-walked down a small ravine, her hand in the crotch of her skirt. Near the bottom of the ravine, she pulled her skirt up and her panties to the side. By the time she was squatting, piss came rocketing forth. A loud hiss erupted from her tired muscles. Her stream of piss kicked up dirt from the ground onto her new boots and droplets of her warm urine splashed the outside of the expensive footwear. Cassie closed her eyes and sighed. The relief was unimaginable, orgasmic, almost. Cassie heard the rustling of leaves. She thought it might be the pervert. They could look for all she cared. She was pissing a strong stream after a good few seconds, and she was enjoying every single moment.

The presence was right next to her. She figured if they were going to take her, at least she had experienced the sweetest relief before hand. She opened her eyes. Mary-Ann had her skirt hiked up, and her panties around her ankles. She had squatted next to the still peeing Cassie.

“Room for one more?”

Without waiting for a response, a second distinct sound came from the leaves beneath Mary-Ann’s heels.

“I had to pee too.” She smiled at the still peeing Cassie.

Should anyone have looked down the ravine, it was obvious what the two women were doing. Cassie’s stream was finally starting to temper off, but Mary-Ann’s was still going. It sounded like rainwater on the leaves, and a distinct crackle emanated from them. Her body didn’t hiss the way Cassie’s had. It was nearly silent, but the relief was just the same. Cassie had stopped peeing for their most part, only dribbles and drops remained. Sighing, she talked to her boss, who was still peeing

“You know, you really aren’t like Sarah at all.”

Mary-Ann looked to Cassie, a stream of piss still visible underneath her.

“What do you mean?”

“She’d have never stopped. She’d have told me to hold it. Your cooler, more willing to accept that others aren’t perfect. I should have given you more credit. And I think I’m still angry at Sarah.”

“I wish she knew that everyone has to pee.” Mary-Ann was nearly empty. Her stream stopped immediately. Then started again, much weaker

“Does this job make you pee in strange places a lot?” Cassie asked, half-joking

“No. Why?”

“I didn’t bring anything to wipe with. I’d want to be prepared for it next time.”

“Just use your panties.” Mary-Ann’s stream was done. She was dripping as she stood back up, and those drops wet her panties as she pulled them back over herself

“Like that?”

Mary-Ann nodded. Cassie followed through. Her already wet panties covered her. They were cold.

“Thanks”

“What for?”

“For letting me pee, and not being weird that I did it here.” The two started to walk up the ravine back to the car

“Thank you for getting the courage to tell me. It’s not easy being so brash. But I don’t mind, honestly. “

The two climbed back into the SUV. Mary-Ann continued.

“If you’ll promise me that you’ll try and produce for Karenna. And I’m not asking you to like her- I’ll take you to that talk Donovan asked me to do.”

“Your a cool person to work for Mary-Ann. Thanks.” The two smiled

“Just- If either one of us needs a bathroom break, lets be more open about it.”

Cassie smiled and looked out the window. She didn’t have to be the tough girl around Mary-Ann anymore. And though she wouldn’t yet admit it, part of her hoped she wouldn’t have to be the tough girl around Karenna anymore either.

OK! So we still don't know Cassie's story, but enough hints to know that there's a story to be told and more insight into her character. All good stuff.

Meantime Sarah is being lined up as the villain.

}}

And kind of a nasty villain too.

I'm glad Cassie's character is starting to become a little clearer, and I think she'll have won us over by 4.6, though she's not really in 4.5.

Also, and this is a question for any other reader as well. Is there not enough omo in this story? I know we've had a ton of pee scenes recently, but the truth is, I like writing both types of scenes. Or is the balance still ok?
