A/N: As some of you may recall, in the fall of 2021, I started a story called "I think my boss needs to pee". What was originally going to be just two stories quickly grew to a great number, and encouraged me to write more and more. There was just one problem. When I looked back over my work, I came to realize that I didn't like how somethings turned out, and I wanted another shot at it. So I rewrote the first two chapters and have many more planned out this time. New characters, new backstories, and bolder interactions. I am keeping the original up for posterity, but this new thread is the only cannon story. Updates will be slow, but they will be worked on. Some of the tags relate to later parts. As always, feedback is not only encouraged but appreciated.

Chapter 1.1

Mary-Ann laid still for a moment. Her morning alarm was blaring into her eardrums, but every muscle in her body wanted to stay in bed until she drifted back into sleep. She couldn't. She wouldn't. Today was the biggest day of her young career, and she'd be damned if she would oversleep today. She gingerly sat up, and switched off her alarm.

Still in the dark, she stood. Guided by instinct, she shuffled towards the wall. Feeling around for the light switch made 4:30 feel like the darkest hour of the morning. She blinked rapidly in an attempt to adjust her eyes to the dark and took her long t-shirt off as she entered her bathroom. She tossed it in an opposite corner of the room and walked towards her toilet. Before she relived herself for the morning, she turned the shower on to let the water warm.

Opening the toilet lid and quickly dropping her pink panties to the floor, she sat on the toilet, still groggy.

Yawning, Mary-Ann started to pee. The sound of her slow stream hitting the toilet water was drowned out by rushing shower water, and she begun to twirl her shoulder length blonde hair. Today was going to be her arrival. The finale of nearly three years of arduous work. She had gone from drifting between office jobs and secretarial roles, barista and bartender, but now she finally found her calling. She was a mortgage officer, and now was one of the top in the nation.

Soon, her steady flow of urine began to arc back towards her pussy, wetting her lips with the excess flow. In a moment, Mary-Ann was done. She sat and dripped as she thought about her tasks for the day. She had been aggressive in the real estate market, flipping houses and even buying her first rental property last year. However, the income earned from the small complex was hardly worth the constant calls. At first, the tenants would call her directly as the previous owner had neglected the apartments. The calls never stopped, at all hours of the day and night, rodents, water heaters, showers and more had been replaced, repelled and repaired. She had hired a property manager to take the calls off of her plate, but whenever an issue arose, her manager would call her before making a move, which delayed solutions and got in the way of her tenants' lives.

Mary-Ann flushed and stepped into the shower. She'd clean the pee off of her privates with the showerhead. Once finished, she lathered her c-cup breasts and washed her body, mentally preparing for the biggest meeting of her life. A chance to own her own mortgage company lay ahead of her, it was the pearl of her life. The 10 and 12-hour days, the early months of being commission-only, when she made less than minimum wage; it was all about to pay off. This last meeting was all that was in the way.

Taking the time to fantasize about her life before her, it took a while before Mary-Ann stopped the water flow and stepped out of the shower. Drying her 5' 10" frame was not an arduous task, but Mary-Ann was sure it took longer than most girls. She packed her gym clothes; a gray pair of spandex and a white top, and her office clothes. She quickly made her hair into a ponytail, walked her to the kitchen to fill her water bottle and left.

###

Karenna Bryant awoke, smacking her dry lips together. The sheets and the bed were cheap, but comfortable. What was strange to her, was the amount of light in the small apartment. It should have been darker than this. She looked over to the alarm clock. Seven. She was late. Very late.

Damn it! Not today! Shit, shit!

She contemplated skipping her shower that morning. But she hadn't showered yesterday either. She'd have to clean herself even just a bit. Today was her bosses big day, and potentially a massive boost for her career as well. Today was not the day to be late.

A quick shower still took her too long. With little time to do her makeup, she was forced to forgo her routine morning pee. As soon as she was dressed in her grey suit pants, black belt and white blouse, Karenna was nearly out the door. Before exiting her small apartment, she grabbed a plastic water bottle from the refrigerator. Needing to beat Mary-Ann to work, she darted out the door, her heels clicking on the cement walkway outside her apartment. As she made her way to her car, Karenna regretted her haste. Her bladder was already asking for relief.

###

What took Mary-Ann a moment was the process of applying professional makeup in a gym bathroom. Normally, she would have applied it at the office or at home on her non-workout days, but because this meeting started right 9, she had to change here. She had changed her panties, which were now a deep purple, and she pulled her pantyhose over them. A beige pencil skirt that dropped to her knees and a white blouse hid under her short blazer. After putting on her black heels, she admired herself in the mirror and remade her blonde hair into a low-professional bun.

Her watch read seven-thirty, plenty of time to visit her favorite local coffee shop. It didn't take her long to get there, and she finished her second water from her tin water bottle. Two had been downed since her workout.

The first scent that hit her was one of her favorites- fresh roasted coffee, and a lot of it. The morning rush appeared to have dwindled. All that was left were the amateur writers and college students. Mary-Ann walked right up to the counter with no line. The barista recognized her immediately.

Hanna was always so sweet and friendly, her small stature made it appear as though Mary-Ann was much taller than she actually was. Her blue eyes met Mary-Ann’s green and their smiles were matched.

"Mary-Ann! Can I get you the usual? Cute top by the way".

Hanna seemed much more energetic than usual, she swayed from one foot to the other and bent her knees ever so often. While certainly not unwelcome to see such energy and vigor so early in the day, it was a bit out of character for the usually reserved girl.

"Aw, thank you! Yeah, I'll have the usual. Had your coffee today?" Mary-Ann smiled wider; she was always happy to see others so gleeful.

"Just been standing a while."

Hanna turned towards the cappuccino machine to start Mary-Ann's order and crossed her legs. They were clad in light jeans. She put both hands on the machine's table and continued to bounce her knees. She looked a little sick and Mary-Ann couldn't help but worry. As the cappuccino machine's noise rang throughout the shop, Mary-Ann spoke up.

"Are you sure you're alright?"

Hanna turned back toward Mary-Ann; her light brown barista apron was bunched around her crotch. She smiled, forcibly, and tried to talk over the end of the machine's cycle.

"Uh...yeah. I'm doing ok" Hanna crossed her legs again, and grabbed Mary-Ann's order. Mary-Ann took her wallet out of her purse and prepared to pay. As Hanna walked back up to the register she put Mary-Ann's order down and read her the total. Hanna sheepishly looked behind Mary-Ann, and upon seeing there was no one behind she whispered.

"I'm really sorry but we're a little understaffed right now; and I really...really need to pee." As she got to the second "really" she bent her knees down again.

As Mary-Ann heard the word pee, she felt a sympathetic twinge in her own bladder and felt terrible for the girl behind the counter.

"I can wait a moment if you need to run- "

"No! No, if that's all your getting, I'll ring you out" Hanna interrupted her a bit loudly.

Mary-Ann paid with her card and put a twenty in the tip jar. She felt sorry for the poor girl, but there wasn't much she could do except give her a generous tip and leave the girl to hopefully find relief, with a lull in customers

"H-have a nice... day" Hanna weakly called to her.

Mary-Ann briefly turned and waved to her before heading out the door, back to her car.

###

The ride to the office was short, but as Mary-Ann pulled into a parking spot opposite the office doors, she felt her bladder give her another dull warning, but this time, it didn't leave; the two morning bottles of gym water had started to collect in her bladder and the cappuccino wasn't helping. As Mary-Ann entered her office doors, she was greeted by her protégé Karenna.

"Hey boss, meeting room's ready." Karenna was an average built black woman, but she had accented her shoulder-length, straight black hair with dyed-red tips.

Unaware of Karenna’s own desperation, Mary-Ann secretly wished the 23-year-old had been a little late. Their typical morning briefs would lead right up to nine o-clock, and if the room and Karenna were already good to go, she wouldn't be able to stop by their single person bathroom. Mary-Ann could only hope she would have time to relieve herself before her meeting.

Karenna stood up from her desk and pressed down her grey suit pants. She gathered her notepad and filed in behind her boss into the small conference room. Before sitting down, she put down her things on the conference table and wiped a bit of fuzz off of her grey suit coat. Mary-Ann didn't need to know that Karenna had gotten there just minutes before and she still hadn't emptied her bladder, which she had now been nursing since she woke up. But the meeting in which she was mostly presenting didn't faze her. She had been in this position for eight months now, and she wasn't about to let her growing need interrupt such a tight schedule, especially today. She sat down at the conference table and Mary-Ann stepped up to the awaiting projector. A list of clients appeared on the screen as the projector adjusted itself.

"Where do we stand on these?" Mary-Ann started

"Jones and Richardson both are looking like they'll get underwritten today. I think we'll have issues with Wyatt though. They might have given us some bad info on the underwriting paperwork." As Karenna went into detail about each of the active clients, Mary-Ann discreetly crossed her legs and put her back to the wall. This action went unnoticed by Karenna, who had her own thighs pressed against each other.

The two women continued to review the second page of active clients, and as they discussed a peculiar case in which the client had provided their proof of income from a job they left two weeks prior, Karenna felt her first serious wave of desperate pressure press against the walls of her shaved pussy. The additional effort that it took for her to hold her filled bladder caused her to hesitate mid-sentence

"I can make that...mmhf...call today"

Despite her growing desperation, Karenna was determined not to ask for a break. If this meeting dragged on too long, she could delay Mary-Ann, she wasn't about to do that. The only thing she was hoping for is that Mary-Ann didn't notice her situation. As she crossed her legs and subtly placed a hand against her crotch, Karenna finally admitted to herself,

I need to pee

Mary-Ann was also growing acutely aware of her own situation, and had begun to sway her hips in an attempt to ease some of the pressure that was developing in her bladder. While she was paying attention to what Karenna was saying, she was unaware of the equally desperate situation her protégé was in.

The two continued to move the meeting forward, discussing where they were in terms of their goals for the year. Karenna at this point was pressing her backside down into the cushy office chair, the corner of the chair pressed into her crotch. Her calves were locked in place, as her heels and feet were supporting most of her forward weight, they were pointing towards each other to keep her thighs in place. When Karenna looked back up from her papers and finished her sentence, she noticed that Mary-Ann was crossing her legs and seemed to be more focused on the projected graph instead of what Karenna was saying. Mary-Ann's right arm was clutched against her left forearm, and as she swayed back and forth.

Do we seriously both need to piss right now?

The thought crossed Karenna’s mind as her boss hadn't responded to Karenna's statement yet. She seemed to be more so watching the clock than giving her undivided attention. Karenna spoke up

"Your thoughts?"

"Hmm? Oh, yeah, its fine. Good job today, Karenna. Is that all?"

Karenna wasn't satisfied with the non-answer, but it was getting close to nine, and if she could get out a moment sooner to pee, she would take it.

"I think that's it for now, I'll email you if any of this changes- I gotta step out for a second, your office should be set up."

"I -uh, alright" Mary-Ann started a sentence, but Karenna had already stood and done a 180 towards the door.

She walked back to her desk as fast and as discreetly as her heels would let her, her sensitive genitals as tight and contracted as she could get them. Throwing her meeting notes over her desk and craning her neck to briefly check Mary-Ann's office, which was in a windowed room behind her desk, Karenna made sure her boss had everything she needed. Karenna might have to piss like a racehorse, but she still had a job to do. She exhaled as the strain to stand on her tip toes caused her bladder to contact and a shiver involuntarily sent a hand to her crotch. Mary-Ann's office looked in order. Now slightly hunched over, Karenna hustled passed the front door, which was glass, and anyone in the parking lot could see her squirm in front of her desk.

Starting to doubt that she was going to make it, Karenna walked quickly to the corner of the office space that housed the only bathroom. Karenna nearly ran into the white tiled room. With just a single toilet and a sink, she started to undo her black belt and turned her well-toned ass towards the toilet bowl, anticipating her long overdue release. In her haste, she pulled the belt too quickly and it stuck into place. She felt a wet drop touch her panties. Not wanting to wet her pants, Karenna used what was left of her strength to pull her belt forward and slowly undo it. As her fingers worked the tight belt, her legs shook. The strain of holding an entire morning's worth of pee was now solely on her tight and tiring bladder muscles. She could feel the first few drops slowly dribbling into her underwear. Finally her belt let go, she jammed her fingers into the waist band of her grey suit pants and flung them down to her knees, along with her panties.

Before her butt had even touched the porcelain of the toilet seat, a thick, fat stream of piss shot out of her, splattering the back of the raised top before Karenna sat down in a huff, exhausted from the effort it took to avoid pissing her pants. A loud hiss filled the room as a clear-ish stream of hot urine drilled the water in the toilet bowl. Her pussy lips now dripping pee as well, having left her blue panties with a small dark patch.

Her breathing slowed back to normal, but her stream stayed strong, and the aspiring black business women sat with her forearms on her thighs, trying to process her desperation and now incredible relief and get her head back to her work.

Her stream seemed to slow for a moment, but Karenna contracted her bladder muscles again and the stream that was exiting her pee hole resumed with the same force that it had started with, and the hissing sound that was erupting from her thighs filled the room again. As her stream began to subside for a second time, she examined her panties. She ran her fingers though the fabric, and while it was slightly damp to the touch, they were more than serviceable. She was surprised at what a close call she just had and she sat back in relief.

Her stream was just a slight trickle, but her muscles were still contracting, sending shivers from her pussy through the rest of her body. It felt good, in a way. Karenna's thoughts drifted back to work

I really hope Mary-Ann was just checking the time...

Karenna cut that train of thought short. She tried to convince herself that Mary-Ann was indeed just checking the time and making sure she wasn't late. This move was important for both of their careers, obviously that would weigh on her mind.

I've seen her take back-to-back meetings for an entire day's work. She's sat through 3-hour licensing classes with a ton of coffee...there's no way.

Karenna looked down at her own, now dripping pussy. Her pink wet skin contrasting with her dark outer lips.

It's not like I didn't just think that I'd be fine.

She wiped, flushed and pulled her pants back up. Reapplying her belt and checking her makeup in the mirror, she noticed that the back of her grey sport coat had gotten wet from her initial explosion. It fared the worst out of all her clothes, but it would dry before the days end, she was sure of it. Her thoughts drifted back to her boss for a moment.

There's no way she needs to pee...right?

Mary-Ann Adimari needed to pee. As she watched her young colleague rush out of the room, she pressed her hands against her skin, just above her burning genitals. It was tender, and her tight pencil skirt did little to assist her. Though it was a long skirt, which reached her kneecaps, it was becoming harder and harder to stand still. Her movements had nearly become involuntary, all made worse by the fact that she was in heels. She walked out of the conference room and entered her personal office.

A slightly private area, its windows were against just one wall. They allowed her to be aware of what was happening outside her semi-private walls. Her bookcase, which served more as a prop for virtual meetings than actually useful books, was against the back wall, and the opposite wall partially served as a wet bar for closings. She had just refilled the alcohol shelf yesterday, and the different color liquids only served to mock her at this point. The deep red rug that spanned much of the floor gave the room a sophisticated atmosphere and played well with the walnut-colored bookshelves and mahogany desk.

Mary-Ann wasn't paying attention to any of these details as she shoved her meeting notes onto her desk and trudged towards the bathroom in the main office space. She had maybe 30 seconds, but she was also starting to feel her now desperation to pee. She assumed Karenna was done as she approached the door, but the light wood was hardly sound proof. She was instead greeted by a such a loud sigh and a hissing sound that her mind instantly attempted to release her bladder muscles. The sound and sudden force of pressure baring down on her tight snatch caused Mary-Ann to shove her hands deep into her crotch and squeeze every muscle she possibly could. Her thighs and genital walls were all directed to halt the force liquid from soiling her clothes. Karenna clearly wasn't done, and Mary-Ann would be unfashionably late. She winced, attempted to straighten up, and walked back towards her office.

As she sat down, some of the other financial partners and representatives from her current company were starting to join the meeting. Sitting in her black office chair, Mary-Ann turned her camera on, forced a smile, and hoped that she could pay attention for just an hour and a half.

###

Karenna had been answering emails and making few morning calls from her desk while occasionally grabbing a drink from the water cooler outside conference room. Despite her close call this morning, she still needed to refresh ever so often and the short walk from her desk to the water cooler was enough to give her mind a quick rest. What helped the day go by the fastest however was the occasional inbound call. For a better connection, they still used landlines, so she could also fiddle with the cord while she talked. It was like her grandmother's old phone when she was growing up, and a little burst of nostalgia was all she needed sometimes. This time, when it rang, it was a local realtor, looking to connect with Mary-Ann. After the two set a time and a day, Karenna hung up and looked back through the glass at her boss.

From where she was sitting, Mary-Ann appeared to be focused on her meeting, and Karenna immediately felt better about her own relief this morning. She hadn't forced her boss into an uncomfortable position and she felt her dash for the restroom was justified.

Mary-Ann was attempting to look professional, but she was as stiff as a statue. Her bladder felt like a rock, and she rubbed her free hand across the tense area. It felt as though every muscle was active in a desperate struggle against herself. No longer was her bladder simply suggesting that she find a time to relieve it, it was now demanding she do so. Sarah, Mary-Ann’s lawyer and acquaintance was in the middle of negotiating Mary-Ann out of her current contract, something that the other two men present in the meeting weren’t allowing to happen easily. The meeting was starting to appear as though it was was going to drag on. Mary-Ann crossed her legs. She hoped they would take a break soon.

###

The front door swung open and Karenna immediately broke into a smile. Her best friend proudly strode through the door with a jovial smile plastered on her round face. Her bright brown eyes put her youth on display, helped by her long, black braided hair.

"Hey girlie! Surprise!”

She presented a small box from behind her back. It was wrapped neatly in a bow and Karenna took it from her graciously. Getting up from her desk, Karenna gave Nia a friendly hug.

"Oh my gosh Nia! Thank you so much! What is it?"

"I was in town for a game and thought of you when I saw it. Open it!"

Karenna did as Nia asked and slowly opened the box. A small silver necklace with a pendent stood out against the dark interior. Karenna took it out and put it on. Now Karenna was the one with a wide smile on her face.

“You didn’t have to.” She said quietly, her emotions taking hold.

“But I wanted to.” Nia reached back over Karenna’s desk for a friendly hug.

"Is Mary-Ann here today?" Nia asked innocently

"She is, but she's in a super important meeting, I'll be sure to let her know you stopped by though."

“Would she mind if we hung out for a little?”

Karenna looked towards Mary-Ann’s office. Her boss looked engaged in her meeting. Turning back to Nia, Karenna suggested

“Yeah I guess we could talk for a little.”

Motioning for her friend to follow her, Karenna led Nia into one of the conference rooms, excited to catch up with her friend.

Mary-Ann was still trying to present herself as a power broker, but in her mind, she was very obviously rocking back and forth in her chair. Her knee was lifted towards her chest in an attempt to alleviate the pressure. She one hand plastered against her crotch. Mary-Ann no longer knew what they were talking about, and at this point was blindingly agreeing to the documents presented online, Sarah marking every initial down. Her jaw was locked in an attempt to remain composed, but her labored breathing gave her situation away. She hoped that her microphone hadn't picked anything up. She didn't think that she had leaked yet, but her strained muscles were starting to produce a sweat. Mary-Ann couldn't tell anymore. All she wanted was to pee. Just not in front of the present company, or with any audience really.

Nia took a seat at the head of the table in the conference room and Karenna took the chair to her right. Playfully rotating the office chair from side to side, Nia asked

“So…you made it. White-collar Karenna, huh?”

Karenna scoffed “Hey, it beats working at that burger place. To be honest, I’m not sure why she even took me in.”

“Who? Mary-Ann?”

Karenna nodded “It’s not like I have experience. Or qualifications.”

“She had to have seen something in you.”

Karenna looked at the ground. “I lied on the application.”

“And?”

“And if Mary-Ann ever found out, I’m sure she’d fire me on the spot.”

“Or she doesn’t care and thinks you’re the right person for the job.”

Karenna looked up, then out the window, not responding. Nia knew better than to ask her friend to have some confidence, but she wished Karenna would at least have some. Her friend looked back at the ground, sparking Nia’s curiosity

“Something else on your mind?”

Karenna looked up, her eyes giving her away. Nia has seen it before. It always looked cute. Karenna’s eyes would widen, showing her whites. She’d almost look like a dog that had done something wrong.

“It’s…ah it’s nothing” Karenna looked out the window again, then at the table.

“Kar…”

“No! Really! It’s stupid.”

“Seems like you want to talk about it.”

Karenna looked at Nia, then back down at the floor, moving her chair back and forth. She sighed.

“You’re gonna laugh at me.”

“Will I?” Nia asked, almost offended that her best friend would even think such a thing

Karenna paused. “I…I kind of have…” Karenna spoke quietly, Nia leaned forward to hear it. “I kind of have a crush on her…”

Nia giggled as she leaned back “Aww! Kar’s in love?”

Karenna looked away and folded her arms “I knew telling you was stupid.”

Nia leaned forward and touched Karenna’s thigh, just above her kneecap.

“Kar, c’mon. You know I’m here for you. So you have a little crush, what’s the big deal?”

“The deal is that it’s stupid-”

“You’ve said that a hundred times now.”

The two went quiet as Karenna searched for her words. She spoke again.

“She's probably not into girls. Much less me. I mean if she was…she’s like a super model. She could have anyone.”

“And you’re not?”

“I’m me. A nerd who just has a silly office crush.”

Silence between the two. Nia wanted nothing more than to grant some sort of confidence towards her friend. Maybe some humor would help.

“Nice ass?”

“Who?”

Nia gave a sly smile. Karenna knew who she meant, lifting her hand to her mouth in embarrassment as she admitted

“Oh! Y-yeah…she does…”

Nia giggled “You been looking?”

Karenna’s eyes dropped, she had a small smile on her face, enjoying her friends playful teasing.

“She’ll bend over my desk to get something, or restock the printer. And when she does...” Karenna’s voice went low “I could die and go to heaven”

Nia smiled, swaying back and forth in her chair. Nonchalantly she grabbed one of the free pens sitting on the table. She spoke, her tone getting a little more serious

“Do you think I’m pretty?”

Karenna furrowed her brow. “Sure. You know that ”

“And you’ve had me. How’s she any different?” Nia fiddled with the pen

“She’s my boss. And besides…it’d be too awkward. I-I can’t.”

Nia shrugged. “You can’t even tell her she’s pretty? Drop a hint or two?”

Karenna shook her head and looked at the ground. “It’ll pass. It’s just a silly crush.”

The two returned to silence for a moment. Nia spoke first

“Well it’s been great, but I should get going. Seriously. Maybe she’d be into you. Give it a shot.”

“Thanks.” Karenna smiled as she stood.

It was nice reconnecting with her longtime friend, and Karenna stretched. It had been quite the morning, but the afternoon was looking to be a smooth close to the day. After a hug, the two friends left the conference room, with Karenna moving towards her desk and Nia towards the door. As Karenna got to her chair, Nia stopped just before the door and turned back around.

"Actually, um...Do you mind if I use the bathroom real quick?"

"You know what?" Karenna smiled slyly, joking with her friend “What if I said no?”

Nia smiled back, but her voice was serious. As she spoke, her hand, which was balled into a fist was gently place at the crotch of her jeans.

“Kar, I've actually have been waiting awhile.” She jiggled her thighs “Please?”

Karenna pointed her towards the bathroom door and watched her friend walk causally towards it. It was on her mind after their conversation, and Karenna couldn’t help but sneak a look at the butt of Nia jeans as she walked by. Her friend really did have a nice ass.

Karenna then turned a little red. She quickly heard an audible hiss and spray from the bathroom, followed by a sigh from her friend. Her mind went back to her adventure this morning. Now that Mary-Ann had been in her meeting for a while, she only hoped that her boss was in a good spot.

###

Mary-Ann was locked in a desperate battle against herself and her overfilled bladder. Every muscle was in full force. Tense. Locked. Active. Unable to remove her hand from her crotch, she was gripping her self as tightly as she could. She felt clammy. Almost sick. Her legs trembled, each muscle moving involenterily with the strain of holding back her stretched bladder. She hurt. Mary-Ann’s teeth were gritted, her lips locked as she tried desperately to keep her pee from bursting out of her.

She nearly considered peeing in one of her wet bar glasses. Mary-Ann was sure they couldn't handle two of her gym water bottles and a cappuccino, but it was better than peeing in front of the CEO of one of the largest mortgage companies in the nation, her attorney and business broker. That very real fear was the only thing that was keeping her water in at this point, and even that was failing. With just a few minutes left in the meeting, Mary-Ann lost a spurt of pee into her panties and her shaking legs were attempting to close the now burst dam, but now that it had started, she was afraid that it wouldn't stop. But another minute passed.

The last page. It was here. Freedom. One more initial and she could have her empire and her salvation. She leaked again. The shock caused her to inhale and she gripped her mahogany desk. With every fiber of her being, she willed her pee-hole closed. Yes. She told Sarah to sign off on the last NDA. She lost again, this time a jet of pee, with a stream thick enough to tickle her closed, burning genital walls. The front of her beige pencil skirt now sported a small dark stain. But it was over, the greatest meeting of her life was over. She might just make it.

The virtual meeting was ending. The first man dropped off the call, then the other. Quickly, only Sarah remained. Mary-Ann felt as though she was drowning. The weight of her full bladder pulling her down in a sea of despair. She was struggling to breathe. Her legs, clad in pantyhose, were curled around each other like a vine. Twisted and tense, they attempted to hold back the deluge of hot piss in her tender bladder. It was no use. Mary-Ann felt a hot jet of piss spray into her panties. She gasped, her twisted legs parting under the desk.

“Everything ok?” Sarah asked.

“I-ah…um…” Mary-Ann looked down.

A constant leak into her panties had begun. The clear, glistening liquid was starting to darken her chair below her. She could feel the searing heat against her crotch. Mary-Ann made a desperate plea, using the last of the strength to muster a statement.

“I…need the bathroom…” Mary-Ann’s voice shook with the rest of her trembling body.

“Yeah me too. You can wait.” Sarah either didn’t care or wasn’t aware of Mary-Ann’s plight.

Mary-Ann was just able to regain control. She could feel the damp wetness of her skirt against her butt, her now soaked panties clinging to her privates. And through it all, she saw a way out.

As Sarah droned on about the contract Mary-Ann had just gotten out of, confidence suddenly stuck Mary-Ann. Maybe she could make it. She had leaked and spurted enough into her underwear that the urgent feeling was starting to dissipate. She had hope. And that was all she needed.

Finally Sarah ended her thoughts and wished Mary-Ann a good day before dropping off of the meeting. She had no idea the fight that Mary-Ann had been in for the duration, nor the throbbing pain of her full bladder. Mary-Ann for her part had no idea of the effort she was about to expend.

Standing from her damp seat, Mary-Ann attempted to walk from her desk, but the weight of her pent up pee pushed down hard, the force of gravity crushing her now tired muscles. A sudden, heavy, sharp pain stabbed her in the back. The mass of her filled bladder crushing her tired peehole. It felt as though every liquid she had consumed that day was pressing to leave. The agony of her full bladder was not lost on the rest of her body. She shook as she bent down, sweaty, tired and exhausted.

Mary-Ann bit down on her lip, hard enough that she could have drawn blood. Gripping her desk, she crossed her legs and attempted to stand. She just lost another spirt. This one made through her pantyhose and dripping onto the rug below.

As she stood again, now slowly and slightly bent at the knee, Mary-Ann lost another jet of pee. And then another. Finally, she stood. Slightly bent forward, unable to stand fully. The pressure and searing pain screaming at her to relent. She wouldn’t. Her hand jammed into the crotch of her business skirt, Mary-Ann used what was left of her dignity and her strength to walk towards the door. That’s when she had an idea.

The trashcan just on the other side of the door. She could rip her pantyhose down and her panties to the side. She could do it. She was so close. Each step sent a stinging pain through her body. Each movement a herculean task. But she was close. She walked by the wet bar, both shot gasses too small for the ocean of pee inside her. Her eyes bore into the small container willing her to walk through her affliction.

The door swung open. It was Karenna. The sudden movement startled Mary-Ann. She gasped. It was followed by a seeping warmth into her underwear.

“Hey boss! I saw you were offline. Valerie called to set up a meeting and-”

Karenna was thrown off by her bosses response. Her voice was weak, hardly audible.

“I…I’m s-s…sorry…”

In the confusion, Karenna went quiet. Her silence was quickly pierced by a sudden tapping. It was foreign to her ears. Karenna subtily tilted her head in an effort to understand what was going on. Something caught her eye. She looked down. A dark patch was appearing on the rug at her boss’s feet. It was expanding slowly. Karenna’s eyes followed the clear droplets of liquid, her brain slowly putting together what was going on. As their eyes met, Mary-Ann nearly closed hers, tears forming in her eyes. Karenna put it together. Her jaw dropped in shock.

Mary-Ann was peeing her panties. It started quick, the first stream finally breaking through her panties and splashing loudly onto the rug. She gripped the heim of her beige skirt in a feeble attempt to deny what was happening. Her face burned red in embarrassment, the only sound was her pent up pee ruining her rug with a dull splash. She looked down again. What she was doing hit her. Her pantyhouse were ruined. Wet streaks had formed down her legs where her pee had started to pool in her heels. Hot pee was dripping out the sides of her heels, and dribbling out onto a growing stain on her rug.Mary-Ann desperately tried cut off the flowing urine from her now hissing snatch. She jammed her hand back into her crotch, now soaked and warm.

The pain of her attempt was unreal. It felt like her entire urinary system had bucked against her wishes to stop peeing. For all of her strife, it only weakened her flowing piss. She could no longer stop it, or even attempt to. Her body had gone too far and was too tired to bend to her will anymore. She realized that now. Giving in to her most basic need, she conceded that all she wanted was relief. Her legs shook, glistening as hot piss ruined her pantyhouse. Clear droplets splattered everywhere, dripping all over her rug.

Mary-Ann Adimari, one of the top mortgage producers in the nation, now owner of her own mortgage company, was uncontrollably wetting her panties on her office floor. But Mary-Ann was too busy enjoying the emptying of her overfilled bladder into her panties to care. She didn't care about the rug she was soiling. She didn't even care that Karenna was witness to her hissing pee rushing out of her tired labia. As the many different rivulets made their way from the seat of her skirt to the rug, Mary-Ann bent forward. Her shaking knees and labored breath evidence of her defeat. Even as her rusing pee began to subside, its damage was done. Mary-Ann couldn’t bare to open her eyes as her continued to ruin her rug and undergarments in equal measure.

Karenna could hardly process what she was seeing. Her boss, her secret crush, was a shaking, wet mess. Karenna wanted to hug her. To mother her. Tell her it was okay. Another feeling came over her. She knew what feeling it was. A grotesque perverted feeling of excitement. She scolded herself, and remained silent. Her bosses office was quiet. The rushing storm of her boss’s held urine now passed. Only the occasional drip from her ruined undergarments remained.

Mary-Ann wanted to scream in relief. She was done peeing. The end to her torment was immeasurable. It was as if she had just experienced the most intense orgasm ever. A cold shiver ran down her spine. Her stream had begun to stopped, her over saturated panties dripped the excess urine down into her soaked skirt and small beads of pee rolled down her thighs. Mary-Ann swallowed hard, feeling the tears in her eyes. Ahe briefly wanted to masturbate. In a fleeting moment she imagined herself ripping through her pantyhose and rubbing her clit like a crazed animal.

But reality quickly set in. Mary-Ann was saturated from the waist down in her own pee. She had completly lost control in front of her only employee, and had just ruined a very expensive rug. She had no words. No excuse, no escape.

Her emotions set in. She wanted to cry. She wanted to run. She didn’t. She couldn’t. She stood as still as a statue, not a word spoken between the two women. Until Karenna spoke. Her quiet, soft voice still cut Mary-Ann sharper than any knife could.

"Did you.. um...did, you just pee your pants?"

Expect a greater emphasis on unplanned desperation and pee/wetting!

They could have both peed in the shower and saved water. In Karenna's case she could have also gotten her morning relief without wasting any time.

Karenna's too shy for that! ...For now. Maybe she'll have some adventures that loosen her up.

Love this. I read the first version every time you posted a new chapter. I like that Nia is already in the story. It´s going to be really interesting to read how this will move forward this time.

}}

I felt like redoing the start while keeping some of the same beats of the og story were necessary. It just felt like I shifted a lot in how I write, and I wanted to reflect that by coming back to the earlier ones.

If Nia's your favorite character, you're in luck. She'll be featured a little bit more than before
