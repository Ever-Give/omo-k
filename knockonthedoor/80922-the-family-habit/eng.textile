A/N: As many of you may recall, I was a big fan of a story on this site called "Told To." It was a well-written story about a girl who was told that it was ok to have accidents. The story eventually took some turns and twists that kept it fresh, however, I couldn't get the original concept out of my head. I wanted to try my own hand at a similar idea, without taking the same directions that the now lost user "Peehour" did. I asked via DM if this was ok with them, but they removed their account before I received a response. Because the concept here is similar, let me know if you feel ok with me posting this and continuing it. My other work will return shortly as well.

The Fish out of Water

Camping. Camping wasn’t the first thing that crossed Bailey’s mind when she asked to tag along on the family trip this year. Then again, what did she expect? She asked herself this rhetorical question as she watched the hills roll by her mother’s SUV. Her face was warm from resting her hand on her cheek, and the summer sun beat through the windows.

Turning away from the window, she looked at her sister beside her. She was crinkling the aluminum can of an energy drink as she finished her second can.

“What?”

“Nothing.” Bailey smiled, envious of her sister’s straight hair

“She’s probably making fun of your nose ring.”

“Mom! I’m eighteen now. Besides…” There was a pause, a quieting of tone “You said I could get it.”

Bailey kept her smile, now at her sisters embarrassment “No, I’m just kind of jealous of your hair.”

“Cuz mine’s straight?”

“No, your bangs. I like the blonde highlights.”

Bailey’s sister smiled brightly “Aw, thanks B!”

“At least you two are playing nice.”

“I’m over that high school shit!”

Their mother gasped “Rebecca!”

Bailey jumped in “I’m over that high school shit too!”

The two black-haired sisters looked at each other and giggled. Their mother shook her head, her smile giving away her good mood.

“So. How does it feel to graduate finally Becca?” Bailey asked

Rebecca shrugged “Dunno. Happy its over I guess. How’d you feel?”

Bailey shrugged back, joking with her sister as she said “Dunno. Happy it was over I guess.” She followed it up with a laugh “It was like four years ago, how should I remember?”

“’Like’ four years ago? It was four years ago stupid!”

“Rebecca, don’t talk to your sister that way!”

“It’s fine mom! We can’t all graduate with a 2.6 GPA.” Bailey smiled devilishly at her sister

Rebecca folded her arms “Well, I would have done better if you’d been there to help me sis!”

Bailey backed off, sensing her sister was offended. She offered a response

“Doesn’t matter anymore. You made it!” Bailey praised her sister, who gave a slight smirk.

As the conversation lulled, Bailey leaned back towards the window, watching the picturesque pastoral imagery fly by. She put her earbuds back in, resuming her music. If it was going to be a long ride, she’d at least enjoy it. And she even had her favorite tea to keep her company.

###

A poke against Bailey’s arm startled her out of her trance. It was her sister, who seemed to be rather aimless in her bothering of Bailey.

“What?” Bailey pulled her arm away

“I’m bored. And I have to pee. What are you drinking?”

“Iced tea.” Smiling, and expecting her sister to say no, Bailey offered “You want some?” She smiled a mischievous smile as she rattled the ice in the silver thermos.

“Sure!” Rebecca snatched the thermos from her sisters hand and took a long gulp from the metal straw

“Becca!” Bailey snatched her thermos back “I thought you said you had to pee?”

“I do.” Rebecca smacked her lips “Good stuff.”

“And you had the energy drinks?” Bailey was surprised

“Yup!” Rebecca nodded seemingly unfazed

Feeling her own slight need even as she had plenty of tea left, Bailey was confused at her sisters callousness. Their conversation hadn’t been all that quiet, and their mother chimed in from the driver’s seat.

“Do you girls need to pee?”

Bailey was taken aback at the directness of their mother’s question. Even more surprising however, was her sisters response

“Yeah, I had those two energy drinks…and I’ve been waiting awhile now.”

“Ugh. Tell me about it. I had that iced coffee, and a water. I’ve been waiting a long time too, girls.”

Bailey was shocked at how open the two were. She tried to brush it off as just the fact that her Mother and Sister had probably gotten close while she was away at school. The conversation returned to some normalcy as the sisters mother asked Rebecca to look up the closest rest area.

“Aren’t we about to go up that mountain?” The large land mass loomed in the distance, towering over the winding road.

“Yeah, why?” Their mother asked

“Might not be any area’s to stop.”

“We’ll be ok.”

“Oh. Never mind.” Rebecca almost sounded disappointed. “There’s one at the bottom of the mountain, phone says just 12 miles from here.”

“Ok then. We’ll wait.”

Bailey thought that was the end of it until their mother picked up her used plastic cup. The one that once housed her iced coffee.

“Unless you two want or need to share this?”

Bailey’s eyebrows furrowed, partly in surprise, partly in revolution. She looked to her sister for confirmation, to ensure she was right in her reaction. She wasn’t expecting her sister to mouth a question

Do you want to?

No! Bailey mouthed back, shocked.

“Bailey wants to wait.” Rebecca announced

“That’s fine. But we’re in the car, we’ll wait until we get to the rest area, alright Rebecca?”

Bailey’s sister sighed. “Fine.”

Bailey sat in silence for a moment. She twisted her curly black hair. She rubbed her eyes. Maybe she was dreaming. The kind of dream she sometimes mistook for reality. But when she focused again, she saw her sister, her hands now brazenly over the crotch of her jeans, staring out the window.

What an odd conversation

She had no idea what was about to be in store.

###

The conversation played again and again in Bailey’s mind as the SUV smoothly drove along the two-lane road. The pretty meadows and large trees no longer lulled her into a sense of tranquility. Instead, the entire dynamic between her Sister and her Mother intrigued her. Why were they so brazenly talking about their needs? Why were they completely unfazed at the prospect of whether or not they’d find a restroom? Of the handful of times Bailey had been desperate for a toilet in her life, she’d never been so unafraid. She’d certainly never talk like that to her Mother.

Maybe they have just grown close. Maybe I’m the odd one. Bailey shook her head. No. No, that was different.

Bailey picked at some lint on her maroon leggings. She looked over to her sister, who had one leg bouncing at this point, her hands still resting on her crotch.

“Becca, it’s the middle of summer. Why are you in jeans?”

“Why are you in leggings?”

“Because the A.C makes my legs cold in here.”

Rebecca gave her a look. A look that gave the same reasoning. She added

“Plus they look…” She stopped herself

Bailey was confused

“They look what?”

“Hmm…Oh…nothing.”

Bailey recoiled back into her seat as her sister looked out of the window. What is going on here?

It wasn’t too much longer before the family spotted a big blue road-sign. Public Rest Area. Next stop 47 miles.

Without so much as a word, the SUV turned onto the gravel side stop. A few other cars, most with bike racks or other camping equipment attached, littered the parking lot. Few people were actually there, and those that were, were spread thin.

“Bailey?” Her Mom didn’t wait for a response “Honey, can you check the bathrooms here? Make sure they’re clean? I want to talk about something with your sister.”

“Yeah, sure…” As Bailey opened the door and began to climb out of the car, she thought of the question she was just asked “I’m still not going to pee in a cup if they’re that bad though.”

Her Mother turned, and as she responded, Bailey observed her placing the heel of her hand into the crotch of her olive green khaki shorts.

“Bailey, sweetie, you’re not the only one who could really use a break right now. And I’d rather not pee in a disgusting bathroom if I don’t have to. And neither does your sister.”

Shrugging the request off, Bailey shut the door to let the two of them talk and made her way to the public bathrooms.

The long grass that surrounded the narrow main road was peaceful. Dotted with different flowers, and when a car wasn’t passing by, the sounds of insects and birds rang like a melody through the rest area. This peaceable moment was quickly dashed when Bailey approached the small wooden bathroom.

The smell of stale piss that had been cooked in the summer sun mixed with the odor of countless other hikers and campers alike blitzed through Bailey’s nose and invaded her senses. Gagging, she turned away from the small structure. Coughing and gasping for air, she turned back towards the SUV.

From her view, Bailey could see her Mother and sister talking about something. What it was, she couldn’t make out. The two women looked so dissimilar, it was hard to tell that they were mother and daughter. The shortest of the family, Rebecca was also the thinnest. Her blue tank top blended well with her light, acid washed jeans. She had certainly grown in the time Bailey had seen her. Despite this, it their mother was who Bailey had noticed the most change in.

While her hips were wider than her daughters from baring the two of them, she had dropped much of the weight that she used to carry. The stress of being a mother had kept her overweight, but now, finally, she had turned herself into a much healthier woman. Her white t-shirt was tucked into her lose fitting shorts. With a round face and shoulder length hair, she had the appearance of a woman who was in control. She was the first to break her conversation with Rebecca and ask Bailey about the situation.

“How are they?”

“Awful. They smell really bad.”

“Ew! Gross!” Rebecca chimed in. “I’m just gonna pee in my jeans.”

The crassness and social moray of her sisters statement forced a chuckle and snort out of Bailey. Her sister didn’t always joke around like this. Or at least, Bailey thought it was a joke until her mother responded

“Yeah I agree. You need cover sweetie, or are you just going to go now?”

“I think I’d like some cover.”

“Aright. Bailey, can you get a towel out of the trunk and give your sister some cover? She can’t hold it anymore.”

Bailey’s jaw dropped. Her mother folded her arms just underneath her larger breasts and stared at the ground, seemingly in thought. Concentrating.

“I’m doing it on purpose Mom! I could hold it, I just…”

“I’m going on purpose too Rebecca.” Their mom interrupted “It’s ok to admit that you can’t hold it either.”

Bailey felt as if she had fallen into another world. Maybe this was some sort of elaborate prank. Maybe they were just joking with her. A prank to see if she’d do it too. She looked her mother in the eye, wondering if she was going to laugh. To tell her that she was still so gullible. Instead, Bailey couldn’t believe her eyes. Her voice barely audible, a high pitched whisper.

“Mom!” She gasped “you’re peeing!”

A visual confirmation of Bailey’s observation began to appear on her mother’s loose shorts. The olive color darkening to a nearly black shade.

Her mother replied “I told you.” She held up her fingers; listing “I had the iced coffee, and the water. I really had to go.”

Baileys jaw dropped as the same dark stain that had begun to draw itself on the crotch of her mother’s shorts expanded towards her thigh in a quickly widening stain.

Darting down one leg, the quickly expanding stain overran the cuff of her shorts and they began to drip. Baileys mother spoke again as clear urine began to fall freely from her now glistening shorts.

“Bailey, dear. Please help your sister, and stop staring at me.” Her voice was calm and soothing.

As if puppeted by an unseen force, Bailey complied, the shock of seeing her mother so brazenly wet her pants still searing into her mind. The trunk was open. All she did was turn around and grab a multicolored beach towel.

But the sound of multiple streams and drips of clear pee splattering and spraying out of her mother’s shorts was still audible. The gravel and rock under her was changing color as it accepted her accident. A circle developed as random rivulets and arcs of hot pee splattered and smacked the ground. Slower moving beads of piss followed the impressive force, sliding down her mother’s larger, light-skinned thighs.

“Uh, sis? A little help?” Rebecca motioned for the towel, her jean-clad legs now crossed over each other.

Bailey tried to get the reality of the situation out of her mind. In a daze she wondered over to her sister, trying to block out the fact that she could hear her mother enjoying the scenery. And pissing her pants.

As soon as Bailey opened the towel to block the view of her sister from the main road, her sibling widened her stance, her legs now spread. She bent forward slightly and put her hands on her knees. Looking up at her sister, Rebecca’s mouth opened in relief as her jeans began to sport a small spot. It was dark. A magnificent contrast to her light jeans. She closed her eyes as a loud hiss began to emanate from her.

Rebecca’s stain took a much different form from her mothers. Instead of initially pooling at the crotch, then splattering through the heavy fabric, her forceful, hissing accident spread quickly down her stretched legs. Gravity had a better hold on her streaming pee and it pulled her hot urine quickly down the backs of her legs. Closing her eyes, she exhaled in relief and pleasure. Her eyes still closed, with piss running down her legs and now pooling on the ground and in her sneakers, she asked

“Hey B, you haven’t gone this whole time. You must need to go too.”

“I-I…I’m fine.”

“No you’re not!” Rebecca opened her eyes, still peeing and gave a smile as she looked at her sister. “I can tell when you’re lying!”

Rebecca was right, Bailey did need to go. But it wasn’t urgent, and certainly not enough to follow her sister or her Mother’s lead. She heard squishing footsteps behind her, her Mother was walking towards them. Turning her head, Bailey noticed her Mother. Her legs glistened, with rogue drips of piss falling of her legs as she moved. Her shorts now sported a full and very obvious pee stain. The inseam of both her thighs, plus the crotch, almost up to her shirt, was circled by a wide dark patch. She commented on Rebecca’s decision first

“Wow! Honey, I didn’t know you were waiting that long! Look at that puddle.”

Rebecca pointed, taking her hand off her knees.

“Well look at yours! How long were you holding it?”

“Too long. Bailey?” She turned to her other daughter “Are you going to have an accident too?”

Bailey shook her head. “N….no.”

Rebecca shook the last drops of pee off her jeans “It feels good sis! It’s not gross or anything.”

“I-I couldn’t…”

“Sure you could! I show you-“

“Rebecca.” Their Mother spoke sternly. “She said she doesn’t need to have one, she doesn’t have to. But just so she knows, I’m not stopping the car again until we get there.”

Rebecca shrugged and grabbed the towel from Bailey, who provided no resistance. As she waked back towards the car, her shoes squished and squeaked.

“And you even get these cool sound effe-“

“Rebecca, she said no.” Their mother was getting another towel out of the back of the SUV.

Rebecca climbed back into the car, this time, with a towel. Bailey, still not believing what had happened, turned towards the SUV. She got a good look at her mother’s shorts from the back. Stained from the center of her shorts, up and around her butt, and down the backs of both legs, her act was not desecrate. She closed the trunk

“C’mon. We can get there before sundown if we hurry.”

Bailey stood still for a moment. She looked to the puddle her sister left. Then to her mothers. She thought of her own bladder as her need became more apparent. Just what had she missed while she was away?

Just to be clear, I meant posting and continuing this story, not “Told To”. Though that work is a good one
