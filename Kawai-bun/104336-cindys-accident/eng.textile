Cindy was walking home quickly, the only thing she wanted right now was to go to the bathroom. Her bladder was clearly failing her, it wasn't the first time, but she still had no accidents

— "Damn, you shouldn't have drunk that coffee!"

She opened the front door and started quickly up the stairs, her short skirt riding up a little.

Finally she was at the front door, she turned the keys and opened the door. Without removing her shoes, she rushed to the door of the toilet

—"No no no no no no..."

As soon as she grabbed the door handle, a stream of warm urine hit her panties

— "Please no!"

Her panties were instantly soaked with urine, streams running down her legs soaking her stockings and warming her body. Cindy stood there unable to do anything, she couldn't stop wetting herself. Her eyes filled with tears. Humiliated, she cried and sat in a pool of her own urine, which continued to grow beneath her

— "How could I! I wet myself like a little baby! What should I do now? Am I worthy to wear panties now? Now I'll have to wear diapers!"

Cindy stopped urinating, but continued to sit in a pool of urine and cry
