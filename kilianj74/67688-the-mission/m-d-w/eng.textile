Hi, I am new here and this is my first ever omo fiction story. The main characters are college (university) students, Kyren who is 19 and Jared, who is 21. It is going to be a m/m romance so I hope the moderators are okay with it and i get the balance right with sexy scenes - I guess I will find out if this gets posted or not!

###

Kyren was on a mission, and he blushed just thinking about it.

It wasn’t a spur of the moment mission. It was going to require days of complex planning, and had every chance of going horribly wrong. At worse, it could cost him his best friend. That was unlikely, but there was a bigger chance it could create weeks of awkward uncomfortable silence between them. What was more likely would be that Kyren would be thought of as a freak - sent for psychiatric help, and pitied as a victim of an unfortunate childhood (which wasn’t true at all). Or worse of all, that the plan would just blow up in his face and his subject (or target) just wouldn’t understand. But the payoff if it did work was mind blowing. He felt hot under the collar of his denim shirt just imagining the possibilities, and a tingling in his groin also. It was a monumental ask, but if he succeeded in his mission – wow. Just wow. His biggest fantasy would come true.

The mission was, on the face of it, simple.

He wanted to make Jared wet himself.

Wet himself. Pee his pants. Go in his undies. Soak his shorts. God, just turning over the ideas in his mind was likely to give Kyren a boner if he wasn’t careful. And that was definitely not a good idea right now, when the target of his mission was sat less than a foot away from him on the sofa. Kyren ran his fingers slowly through his curly blond hair, as he always did when trying to calm himself down. Now was not the time for getting excited. He needed to be subtle – to play it cool. One step at a time.

Kyren didn’t want to be cruel to Jared. He didn’t want to humiliate or embarrass him in front of anyone else, and he didn’t want to coerce his best friend into fulfilling his fantasy. He wanted to persuade him, coax him into doing it at exactly the right moment – when the situation and setting were perfect. Jared not only had been uncommonly kind to Kyren, he has surprised the college freshman by actually wanting to be his friend from the start of the year.

It was a small college they attended, but Jared was the student body president – tall, athletic, always running or going to the gym, and yet still managing to do this and score good marks in his classes. Kyren, by way of contrast, was fairly nerdy, and sang in the choir. He liked running too on occasion, especially with Jared, who probably indulged him by slowing down quite a bit for his benefit. Kyren didn’t understand why, but Jared actually genuinely enjoyed spending time with him, and he wanted to give Jared something special in return. Which Kyren would. He would give him the pleasure of pissing his pants, which in Kyren’s weird brain was a very good gift to be giving.

###

“Wow – I did not see that that coming.”

Jared’s voice jolted Kyren out of his daydream, and he realised the familiar closing music to Line of Duty was playing already on the TV.

“Huh?”

Jared looked at him suspicially. “The identity of the fourth man – the big reveal – don’t tell me you guessed that? You’re such a detective, Ky, I bet you worked it out weeks ago.”

“Oh. Nah, I thought it was the gaffer’s wife. You know, that got beaten up last season.”

“For real? That’s crazy. You have such a wacky mind.” Jared laughed, and Kyren could feel it in his stomach. Everything about Jared was perfect. His voice, his perfectly slicked brown hair, his white t-shirt and blue jeans which made him effortlessly fashionably without having to try as Kyren spent hours doing. Those “wet look” jeans which had so many different patches of blue on them they could almost be pissed in already and you’d get away with it. Kyren licked his lips…

Suddenly, without much warning, Jared stood up bolt upright.

“Damn. I’m busting for a piss. Didn’t notice how much I need to go sitting down I was so engrossed in the drama. Funny how it can get like that.”

Kyren’s mouth went dry and his heart was pounding at this teasing revelation, but he said in a slightly strained voice, “Yeah, I get that. Takes your mind off it.” That was a complete lie. Kyren had been thinking so much about pissing that the opposite had happened and he had almost lost track of the drama.

Jared bolted for the door. “Be right back. Grab us another beer would you from the fridge? Any will do.”

Kyren thought Jared was doing things in the wrong order. He badly wanted to block the door, order Kyren back to the sofa, then get him to drink the beer then pin him down until he was forced to pee his jeans, but now wasn’t the time for that.

That time would come.

*001*2021-05-09 19:51

As Jared dashed upstairs into the communal college bathroom, Kyren was seriously tempted to follow. His jock friend had stood up so suddenly that Kyren wondered if Jared had accidentally squirted in his underpants and that had startled him into a rapid exit. Had Kyren been a bit braver he would have accompanied Jared step by step to the bathroom, and brazenly stood next to him at a urinal, watching out of the corner of his eye whether there was any evidence of leaking.

Maybe he would have caught sight of Jared pulling himself out of his boxers whilst already peeing (Kyren assumed Jared wore boxers, he seemed too streetwise for briefs). Or if Kyren had headed into a stall, he might have deduced that Jared had to clean up after a slight leakage, and he could check after for any drips on the floor. A more bold version of himself would strike up a conversation in an adjacent stall – jokingly asking Jared if he made it on time, or if it was a “close call”. Jared had been right. He could be a detective when he needed to be.

Instead though, Kyren chickened out, going to the kitchen to do his duty fetching beer. He took out two bottles of Stella, and two pint glasses. Often he drank straight from the bottle, but given that he had company - (Jared was company, not that this was a date ha ha) – he poured the first bottle into a pint glass. He tilted the glass to get the correct amount of head on the pint (not that he knew what he was doing). For a second he thought it bore an uncanny resemblance to piss, and wondered if pissing into a glass would produce head in the same way. Not unless there is something seriously medically wrong with you, Kyren told himself, and now his mind was wandering in all sorts of dirty directions.

He was about to pour out the second bottle for himself when a naughty idea sprang to mind. Kyren thought about Jared in the bathroom upstairs, and wondered if he had made it or leaked a tiny bit into his boxers. There was something exciting, he knew from experience, about feeling a tiny amount of pee in your underpants, wetting the top of your cock. Kyren knew the sensation, having replicated it on several occasions. Sometimes when he was a bit drunk he had deliberately chosen to leak a tiny amount into his pants, enjoying the sensation of warmth among his most private parts.

Taking the bottle of beer in hand, he carefully pulled the waistband of his jeans and boxer briefs away from his body, and positioned the bottle so that a small amount of beer fell into his pants, wetting the white material. The sensation was slightly sticky, and a little bit colder than that feeling he got when actually peeing in his pants, but otherwise the sensations were fairly similar.

Kyren realised that the action of pouring beer into his undies made him need the loo a bit more himself, as if the sensation of the wet material around his groin was granting him permission to pee in his pants. Whilst watching TV with Jared he had not noticed a particular need to go to the toilet, and usually he had could hold for quite a long time, but thinking about Jared wetting combined with the beer was increasing his urge. He decided that because the beer he had poured on himself was a bit cold he would combine it with a bit of pee and warm himself up, so he relaxed and pushed a small amount into his boxer briefs.

It was rather more than he expected, and he could now feel warm wetness right across his underwear – at the front, behind, and underneath. Quickly he clenched his bladder muscles and checked the front of the chinos he was wearing. There was a tiny wet patch but it was barely visible, and fortunately he was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, which he pulled down carefully to conceal the area. After this ritual Kyren realised he had “broken the seal” and needed the toilet more badly. He felt a little uncomfortable holding, but wasn’t anywhere close to a genuine accident, so poured the rest of the bottle of beer carefully into the second pint glass, which was nearly as full the one he had prepared for Jared.

He carried both beers back to the lounge, and sat carefully back down on the sofa, just in time to hear Jared coming back down the stairs and returning to the lounge.

*002*2021-05-10 10:37

Jared threw himself back on the sofa with a sigh of relief. Kyren could see from his relaxed shoulders and ready smile on his face the satisfaction of someone who has just drained their bladder and now had no need at all to be agitated. Kyren was not in that place himself – he was starting to feel the urge to pee and the dampness in his boxer briefs now had him on a state of high alert. But he tried to look casual as he handed Jared his beer. “Feel better?”

“For real.” Jared looked back at him with a cheeky grin. “Bro that was a close call. Been holding it since the start of the episode, but they don’t have ad breaks. Was about to wet myself but didn’t want to miss any of the action.”

Kyren’s ears pricked up instantly, and he felt a tingling sensation of excitement. If what Jared was saying was true, and not just one of those things people say when they need to go, he had been so close to watching his fantasy unfold before his very eyes. Perhaps Jared had leaked already while they were watching TV, not caring too much because he was engrossed in the drama. He imagined a sliding doors scenario of Jared having a real accident – dashing to the door but turning the handle the wrong way, a momentary lapse of judgment that would cause a short circuit in Jared’s brain, causing him to squirt into his boxers, then grab his crotch unconsciously in response while he tried to perform the otherwise simple tax of opening a door.

Then, once that obstacle had been overcome, Jared would dash up the stairs up sheer desperation, two at a time, but just a bit less co-ordinated than normal, would catch his shin on a step and trip, falling hard on the halfway landing. The shock of the event, and the minor pain in his shin would then cause him to relax those bladder muscles that he had been painstakingly controlling for so long. Piss would start pouring out of him forcefully, into his black boxers (now Kyren was guessing), then gradually colouring in dark blue those patchy jeans as the wetness spread. Then the moment of realisation would dawn on Jared, that he was actually peeing in his pants, and in horror he would try to clamp his bladder muscles off, realising that his body wouldn’t allow him to actually do that… then the wetness would spread beyond his pants, onto the hard floor, causing a puddle around his bottom and the back of his legs, like a work of art…

“Earth to planet Ky?” Jared said abruptly. “You totally zoned out man.”

Kyren realised he was still standing from handing Jared his beer, frozen to the spot, and he sat down quickly.

“Sorry. Got distracted.” Too right he had.

Kyren said,” You know we have a pause button on the TV right? I could have waited.”

“Nah, no worries. If you had we would have been watching 10 minutes behind the rest of the country, and some douche on my twitter or my news feed would have probably have blurted out a spoiler five minutes before I saw it.

Kyren laughed. “Jared you are so paranoid”.

“Old habits I guess. I suppose I just don’t like to be out of control, or of surprises.”

“You didn’t seem as in control of your bladder right now.” Kyren said boldly. Now was a chance for him to steer the conversation, if he just played his cards right…

“Touché. I was pretty desperate”. Jared grinned.

Kyren needed to take the chance to press home his advantage, but he had to keep sounding casual. He thought carefully about what to ask next. Have you ever “not made it” to the bathroom? Too forward. How did it feel? Too personal, at least for now.

“How desperate?” he asked quizzically. “I mean, people always say they are desperate, but when was the last time you were more desperate, like close to wetting your pants desperate?”

Jared picked up his beer, and drank a big gulp, as if steeling himself for a response. Then he looked sheepishly at Kyren and said, “Actually, there was this one time…”

{{14 minutes ago, AlmostWet said:

Wonderful start.

Thanks! I've got ideas for the next few sections and am trying to get the pacing right as I don't want the main event to be over too soon. There will be lots of desperation and wetting to come!

*005*2021-05-10 20:49

Jared broke off, suddenly not speaking. Kyren noticed his big blue eyes were fixed on him, and he flinched like a scared deer, as if wondering if he had said too much already.

“Go on”, Kyren said sharply, trying to be encouraging but betraying his impatience.

“It’s a bit embarrassing.”

“Don’t worry, it’s only me, I’m not going to tell anyone. Anyway that’s what the beer is for, getting drunk and saying embarrassing things.” Then Kyren added, “I probably won’t even remember it in the morning”, which was a complete lie.

“What embarrassing things have you done?”

Kyren started babbling before he realised he had been tricked and the tables had turned. “Oh, well, there was this one time as a teenager I went with the school orchestra to play at a concert at a local leisure centre. After the rehearsal, we had bags of time, and we’d been told we could go swimming in between the rehearsal and the concert if we wanted, if we brought our costumes. Anyway, this leisure centre had two changing rooms, one leading to the swimming pool and one for the sports hall. The sports hall one was where we were meant to change into our smarter clothes for the concert.

But being a doofus I mixed them up, and went to the wrong one. So here I was, stripping off and putting on my swimming trunks in the wrong changing room, while my friends stood in shock changing into their dress suits. Then I boldly walked into the showers, which I thought led to the pool, saying “see you later” to my bemused friends and realised I was confronted with a brick wall. There was no way through. So I had to come back to my friends and explain what I was doing in the shower in my swimming trunks. I was mortified.”

Jared snorted into his beer. “That’s hilarious.”

“Yeah it was pretty funny. But it doesn’t get you off the hook, come on. You were about to tell me your embarrassing desperation story.”

Jared sighed, and Kyren noticed his cheeks had gone faintly red. “Fair enough. You remember last term, the college football game against Queen’s Hall, when I was playing in defense?”

“Yes”, Kyren said. Of course he remembered it. How could he not? He didn’t know the first thing about football, or the offside rule, but he remembered staring at Jared’s ass in those tight Blue nylon shorts and his broad thighs above the white socks pulled up to the knees. And he remembered sitting at the front of the stands, cheering loudly whenever Jared got the ball, and how people around him gave him dirty looks because as a defender when Jared was tackling another player it usually meant the opposing team were in danger of scoring. “Go on.”

“Well, the thing is I forgot to go to the loo before we started that game, and had to stay hydrated and drink a lot because it was a really hot day. I figured it would be fine, because I’d just go at half time. But we were really sloppy in the first half, and went 2-nil down, so we had a brutal team talk back in the locker room where the coach laid into us for the entire half time break. Before I knew it was time for the second half, and I was back on the pitch again, and still hadn’t gone.”

As Jared said that, Kyren’s cock twitched slightly, and he felt as excited as if it had been Christmas morning and he was about to open his presents. Okay, he wasn’t a kid anymore, but still hadn’t grown out of those feelings. And the present he was going to get now if he was thinking right…

Jared continued, “The second half was non-stop. Our team had to attack if we were going to stand any chance at all, which meant of course we all pushed up and there were twice as many counter attacks, so we were running non stop. When I was moving I didn’t notice, but in those moments where I stood still, my bladder started screaming at me, and I was clenching all my internal muscles. I genuinely thought I might wet myself, and then wondered if I could pretend to pull a muscle and roll around on the grass, and pee through my short leg.

But there was no way I could do that for the length of time I would inevitably need, and no doubt I would end up being found out and end up in a viral youtube video. So I just tried to hold it, occasionally grabbing my crotch and pretending I was just adjusting my shorts. And with the adrenalin of the match I just danced around a lot and pretended it was all intentional. And I thought for some reason everyone was staring at me, even when I didn’t have the ball, and could see I was desperate and shaking.”

“I remember you did bounce around on the spot a lot in the match,” Kyren admitted. “And I thought that all footballers just did that to stay warmed up. But then I think I was the main one staring at you”.

“Really? You were?” said Jared with a smirk, and Kyren realised he had been found out. “I mean, your my friend, of course I was watching you during the game. As a friend would, of course.”

“Whatever you say”. Jared grinned at Kyren, and reached over to give him a friendly shake on the shoulder. It felt nice. “Anyway we were still 2-1 behind, and I was praying that it didn’t go to 2-2 and go to extra time. I wanted it to be 3-2. Hell, I would have settled for losing 2-1 at that stage.”

“But it did go to extra time” Kyren grinned. “I remember - the equaliser came in the last minute of stoppage time. See, I was paying attention.”

“Look at you, learning words like stoppage time”, Jared teased. “Yes, the game went on another half hour. I was shaking so much by the end. My shorts and briefs were dripping in sweat, and sweat was pouring down my leg, and I had this sinking feeling in my stomach, it might be pee. I panicked, and then I felt light headed, and was worried I was going to pass out, but I didn’t.”

“Was it pee?” Kyren asked a bit too eagerly.

Jared laughed. “No, fortunately, because I was still desperate as ever. I thought about leaking a bit, to let the pressure off, but then I realised I would probably not stop and completely soak my shorts if I did that. But then, thankfully our team scored, and I knew I would only have a few minutes to endure, until suddenly that hulking guy Mason from Queen’s Hall charged into me like a rhino and totally floored me. When the shock hit me I felt a blast of pee squirting badly into my shorts and I really thought that was it, but fortunately I managed with all my efforts to clamp it off quickly.”

What a pity, thought Kyren. That would have been a show.

Instead he said, “So how did it end?”

Jared looked uneasy and averted his gaze from Kyren. “It ended with me sprinting off the field as soon as the final whistle was blown, clutching my crotch as soon as I was out of the sight of everyone. Once I was in the changing room, I didn’t even head for the toilets. I just dived into the showers, yanked my shorts and briefs down, and blasted off into the shower drain. It felt like I’d turned on a hosepipe, and felt so good to let go. I must have been going non-stop for a good half minute but it felt amazing. The relief as much as anything, of not having to hold back any more.”

I bet you enjoyed it, thought Kyren. Then he wondered, if Jared enjoyed that so much, perhaps his mission might stand a chance. But that was getting ahead of things.

“Wow”, said Kyren. He wanted to add “that’s hot”, but bit his tongue. “What did your teammates say?”

“Not a great deal. They teased me a bit for my obvious dash to the toilet, but everyone was pretty buzzed we had won the match so that was that really.”

“Cool,” said Kyren. Then he added “Thanks for sharing” and realised he sounded like some sort of group therapist.

They were silent for a moment. Then Kyren noticed those big blue eyes of Jared’s were fixed on him once again. This time he didn’t look afraid. He looked like he was trying to figure Kyren out, in a quizzical but not unkind way.

“You’re acting a bit odd today,” Jared said finally. “Is everything okay?”

Kyren was flustered, and hesitantly opened his mouth and closed it again. The blue eyes seemed to be looking right through him, seeing all, like the eye of Sauron, except these eyes were kind not cruel.

Finally Kyren said, “It’s just.. do you mind if I ask you something?”

*007*2021-05-12 23:00

For a moment that seemed to last far too long, there was silence, and Kyren felt uncomfortable. He was reminded of the wetness in his underwear from the beer and piss ritual he had undertaken earlier, and he felt the muscles around his crotch throbbing. Suddenly his urge to go to the loo felt ten times stronger than it had before Jared had told his story. He wanted to grab himself, but that would have made his desperation obvious to his crush, and right this second he wasn’t sure that was the wisest move. He calculated that it he and Jared had got to a very important part of the conversation, and he didn’t want to blow it. Kyren wondered if he could leak a bit into his pants, as a way of easing the tension, but because he was nervous his muscles seem to have locked up completely. Despite his desperation, he doubted if he could have peed if he wanted too right now he was so nervous, even if he was alone and standing in front of a urinal or his toilet upstairs.

Eventually Jared said, “Sure you can. Shoot.”

By that Kyren assumed he meant talk, but there were lots of other liquids he could think of shooting.

He said nervously, “I’ve just been wondering, these last few weeks, why it is you want to hang out with me. I mean, you’re captain of the football team, you’re athletic, you’re devilishly handsome..” (Kyren couldn’t believe he just said that) “you get on with everyone, and you do well enough in your classes to not need help from a nerd like me. You could be spending your time with the popular crowd, and instead you are here in my dorm lounge watching TV with a socially awkward freshman.” (With an omorashi fetish, thought Kyren, though he wasn’t going to admit to that right now).

For another few seconds, there was silence again, as Jared said nothing in reply. Then, in a serious but surprisingly hypnotic voice he said to Kyren, “Look at me.”

Kyren did nothing, then felt a rush of warmth as he felt Jared’s hand brush his cheek.

“Look at me Ky,” Jared said again.

Kyren did look up this time, and noticed that Jared’s face was now just inches away from his. He could sense Jared’s warm breaths, which seemed shorter and more excited. Jared’s lip was quivering slightly, and the deep blue eyes now seemed to convey a new sort of emotion – not simply intensity, or even care, but desire.

“I’m looking”. It was pretty obvious, but Kyren said it anyway.

“I want you to listen carefully”, Jared continued. “You are an amazing guy. You are fun, and considerate, and beautiful, though you don’t realise it yet. I had my eyes on you since the day I saw you looking lost by the college entrance with your oversized suitcases.”

Kyren blushed. “But don’t you think I’m nerdy and a little weird”?

“Of course you are nerdy and a little weird.” Jared smirked, and ruffled Kyren’s hair. “But there is honestly no one I would spend my time with.”

He wants to be with me? Seriously?

Kyren sat on the sofa, rigid in place stunned. His logical brain could not process this. Jared, the literal wet dream of most of the girls (and probably half the guys) on campus had chosen him? Why? There had to be a mistake.

He said cautiously, “Do you mean – you like hanging out with me as a friend.”

Jared snorted. “Come on Kyren, you’re smarter than that. You know exactly what I mean.”

Kyren decided to tease him. “Let’s pretend I’m dumb and don’t.”

“Guess I’ll just have to show you.”

Before he knew what was happening, Jared’s interlocked fingers were at the back of Kyren’s neck and he felt Jared’s wet lips around his mouth and his best friends tongue was in his mouth licking his own. A second later he was horizontal on the sofa, where Jared had pulled him roughly on top of him. Kyren could feel the contours of Jared’s chest through just a couple of flimsly layers of fabric, and their crotches of their jeans rubbed together. Kyren could sense the bulge in Jared’s jeans expanding and his own cock twitched.

Then Kyren’s cock suddenly spasmed, and a jet of pee shot out into his pants for a good second. In the heat of the last few moments, Kyren had completely forgotten about his growing urge to pee and the effect the beer was having on him.

Mortified, he realised that he had not only peed in his underwear and skinny jeans, but that the volume of pee would have wet Jared’s jeans, and even maybe even have soaked through his boxers to Jared’s cock and balls. He clamped off the flow and pulled away from Jared.”

“Shit. I just pissed. I’m so sorry.” He wasn’t really sorry, he was exhilarated, but an apology seemed the appropriate thing to say.

Jared simply laughed, and kissed him on the cheek sweetly. “Don’t sweat it, he said. Beer goes right through me too.”

“I didn’t mean to spoil the moment.”

“Who said it spoiled it.” Jared winked, and he had a look of amusement in his face. Then he added, “but for the sake of the college cleaners and this sofa cover, we should probably get you to a bathroom.”

“Want to come with me?” Kyren asked excitedly.

Jared said nothing, but grasped Kyren’s hand, and led him towards the door. Then, although no-one else was around, he leaned over and whispered in Kyren’s ear.

“Of course.”

*008*2021-05-13 17:07

(Warning: Next chapter contains sexy scene)

Kyren did not have an ensuite bathroom, being a first year student, but his room was on a corridor of four or five rooms, with a communal bathroom at the end. The bathroom had a couple of shower and toilet cubicles on one side and sinks on the other. It was unisex, so there were no urinals, but he was on an all male corridor.

As Jared half led, half dragged Kyren by the hand down the corridor, Kyren realised he wasn’t quite walking straight. In addition to being bursting for the loo, he felt a bit drunk - the effect of the Stellas they had been drinking all evening must have been stronger than he thought. He kept stopping to grab himself unashamedly at intervals, and he could tell he was only seconds from a full blown wetting because the muscles in his crotch seemed to be twitching independently, either from excitement or desperation. His whole lower region also felt heavier and slightly numb, a warning sign that the floodgates were about to open. But the prospect of imminent release in the toilet, especially in front of Jared, was and incredible thought, and Kyren felt he had won the lottery.

As they entered the bathroom Kyren made a beeline for the toilet cubicle, but before he realised it, Jared was forcefully steering him into a shower cubicle instead. He stared at Jared in confusion as the older boy drew back the shower curtain, and carried on steering him into the wet part of the shower.

“Well this is unexpected,” Kyren said as Jared’s body sandwiched him to the back wall.

The blue eyes looked back at him intently. Kyren could still see an expression of raw desire, but there was also Jared’s familiar kind concern in them, which made him feel safe. “Are you okay with this?” Jared asked.

“My head is all over the place, I admit. I still don’t know what this is. And I am about to pee my pants. But with you around, I feel okay.”

“Good” said Jared. He was looking Kyren up and down, as if studying every inch of him. Then a mischievous grin came on his face. “I told you I’m someone who likes to be in control. Do you trust me?”.

“Of course”, said Kyren, and he honestly meant it. “I mean, if anyone else had just pushed me against a shower wall when I need the toilet I would have freaked. But with you, it seems perfectly normal.”

“If you feel uneasy or unsafe at any point just tell me,” Jared reassured him. “And remember I am Jared, your friend, who really really likes you. But if you are up for a bit of fun, I have an idea of something I’ve always wanted to do.”

“Fun sounds good,” said Kyren, still feeling like he was living in a dreamworld.

“Okay. Then take off your shoes and socks, and your top and t—shirt.”

Kyren obeyed without question, flinging them into the dry part of the shower.

Now raise your hands over your head and close your eyes.

In the darkness, Kyren felt Jared press his wrists against a metal rail, and he realised it was the top rail for the shower curtain. Then he felt a pair of cuffs being fitted around his wrists, and heard the sound of a click. He opened his eyes and looked at Jared in awe.

“What happens now?” Kyren asked innocently, although he felt he already knew the answer.

“Now I can see you more clearly. And feel you”. Jared ran his cold fingers down Kyren’s bare chest, feeling the contours. Then he felt Jared’s hands on the now glaringly obvious wet patch on his jeans, which was now about the size of a grapefruit, with nothing to cover it. Kyren cringed in embarrassment as Jared’s fingers worked to undo his button. He pulled the zipper down, exposing the pale grey boxer briefs, which were soaking with pee and beer.

Jared was examining him now, like a patient or a scientist who had made an intriguing discovery. He squeezed Kyen’s boxers, as if wringing out laundry, causing the wetness to drip onto his hand. Then he brought his hand up to his face. Kyren felt his face flush, even more embarrassed, as Jared teasingly licked the piss of the palm of his hand.

Then an expression of surprise came on Jared’s face.

“They do say beer tastes like piss, but your piss seems to taste remarkably like Stella.”

“Oh year – I spilled some.”

“You spilled some – inside your underpants?” Jared raised his eyebrows. “Kinky boy.” He kissed Kyren on the lips – just a quick peck, but enough to show he wasn’t disapproving. Then he said. “Wait here for a few moments. I need to get something.”

Kyren opened his mouth in horror. “What? You’re going to leave me here like this?” He’d couldn’t imagine feeling more exposed, handcuffed to the shower with wet jeans opened out to show even wetter boxer briefs.

“Relax,” Jared said patting him on the shoulder. “Actually don’t relax. Hold right there. Don’t worry there is no one around. Move your hands up the rail and I’ll pull the shower curtain across, and if anyone else comes in and you are worried, just lean against the shower button on the back wall and it will start up.

Then Jared was gone, and Kyren continued to hold with all his strength. He didn’t want to let go and wet himself completely. Actually, in some ways he did, but weirdly now he wanted to hold until Jared could see him. He squirmed and jostled from foot to foot, more to distract himself than anything, as he didn’t think it was helping a lot.

Before he knew it, Jared was back with… another can of Stella in his hand?

“What?” said Kyren. “You want to drink another beer and watch me squirm?”

He heard the familiar hiss of gas as Jared popped the can open, and felt jealous that the beer got to release sooner than him.

“Nah – I want you to drink this. Down in one.”

“Seriously? If I do that my bladder will explode. I’ll… I’ll” Kyren faltered.

“You’ll what – pee in your pants Ky?” Jared whispered seductively, and Kyren realised in awe that was what Jared wanted to happen.

He gulped. Then he thought, if Jared wants it, I may as well put on a show. “Okay, release one of my hands and pass me that.”

Jared did, and Kyren tipped back his head and poured the pint down his thoat. He flung the can on the ground triumphantly, and was pleased to see that Jared seemed seriously impressed by the display. A second later, he realised his entire bladder felt bloated and numb and he would release everything in less than a minute, if that.

“Now what?” Kyren said hoarsely. “You have about a minute to decide before my bladder bomb goes off. Think fast.”

“I tell you what, said Jared. I’ll do you a deal. You do one more thing for me, and I’ll let you control this.”

Kyren watched as Jared undid the zip of his jeans, exposing black boxers (Kyren was right!) which were bulging out obscenely. Then he took out the prize, a seven inch, uncut, beautiful rock hard cock. Kyren drooled.

“One more thing, and you can jerk this until I cum. Anywhere. On you, in your mouth, on the floor, in my pants even. Whatever you like.”

“It’s a deal. Say it now, say the one thing I know you want me to do.”

Jared smiled, and whispered in that mesmerizing voice. “I want you to let go of your bladder. I want you to wet your pants, completely, utterly, and helplessly.”

Kyren bit his lip, and looked up shyly at the boy of dreams, six foot tall, slicked hair, a golden smile, and an intense expression that made him want to melt. Not to forget a hard cock protruding out of his flies. He stretched his free hand and gripped the shower rail above him, protruded his hips forwards, and then with a sigh he did melt, in his underpants. A days worth of tension, planning, anxiety, excitement and anticipation rushed out of him with a waterfall of relief. The light gray boxers turned faint yellow as pee bubbled through the surface of the fabric, then travelled down his faintly hairy thies to where his thirsty jeans were preparing to contain the rest of the flood. The heat was intense, and Kyren liked hot showers. For a good while the stream continued, dripping out of the legs of his jeans and forming a large yellow infantile puddle which slowly headed towards the drain.

And then it was all over. Kyren felt Jared ruffling his hair, and then Jared gripped Kyren’s hand and transferred it to his cock.

“I think you need to have a bit of a wet patch too”, Kyren said, after jerking Jared a few times. Then he tucked Jared’s cock back in his black boxers, constantly stroking until Jared growned and the boxers were splattered white, inside and out.

Both boys stood in silence.

Then Kyren burst out laughing. “Where do we go from here?”

Jared said, “Actually I have a confession to make. What I said earlier wasn’t the whole truth.”

“Go on.

“I have a bit of a thing for guys who get desperate or wet themselves. It’s not something I can easily talk about.” Kyren watched Jared’s face get redder, and he looked at him intently. “Anyway, I’ve been into this thing – omorashi – for a long time. And when I first saw you, lost at the entrance lodge, with those suitcases – everything I said was true – I wanted to care for you, hold you, be with you and help you in every way. But also you were wearing that green jumper and those white chinos, and for a split second I also had a guilty wish for you to piss yourself, so hard that I would be able to see the colour of your underwear.”

Kyren opened his mouth in shock, but this time no sound came out, he just looked like a goldfish.

Jared continued, “I didn’t want you to be humiliated, or think less of me, but from that day I made a resolution – I would be the best friend you could hope for – may be even a boyfriend too – but I would one day try to get you to wet yourself. In my head, I suppose it – became a sort of mission. The mission. That’s what I jokingly called it.”

Kyren leaned over to kiss him. “Mission accomplished?”

Jared merely nodded, and as the two embraced and kissed, Kyren thought to himself – your mission may be done, but mine isn’t.

END OF PART ONE.

Hope you enjoyed my first omo fiction as much as I enjoyed writing it! Feedback gratefully received so I can improve future stories and let me know also if you'd like me to write a part 2 with Kyren and Jared 🙂

This has to be hands down one of the hottest stories I have ever read on this platform! I can’t wait to read the rest of the story!

Thanks! I have several ideas in my head where the second part will go but need to organise them before writing.
