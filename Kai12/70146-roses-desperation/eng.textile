This was the second commission from the same guy. Hope you guys enjoy this one as well as the first!

###

Sam really can’t get over just how little her girlfriend uses the bathroom.

For a couple of years now, Sam has been dating Rose, an aerospace engineer and a few years her senior. They’ve been together long enough where she moved into Rose’s house, and that’s where she took notice of the older woman’s lack of toilet use.

The two women were complete opposites for the most part: Samantha, or Sam, was a thin, small, blond haired, blue eyed woman freshly out of college. Rose was taller, curvy, black haired and brown eyed with a well established career. Even their personalities clashed: Sam was quiet and reserved, while Rose had no issues being blunt and loud.

The only similarity they really shared was their degrees in engineering; it was how they met, actually. Sam had an internship her freshman year because of a friend, and her cubicle was directly next to Rose’s. The two women clicked, and by the end of that summer they had gone on quite a few outings with each other. They kept in contact for the full year, and by the next rotation of internships the older woman made it official.

Their dates were usually quite long, an all day affair. It would start by going out for coffee and breakfast that morning, followed up by something like a stroll through the neighborhood park or something similar, lunch, and so on. They wouldn’t return home until long after the sun had set, and Sam would take a minimum of four bathroom breaks throughout the day. Not one time could she recall seeing Rose take a bathroom break.

One day she did a small test: plied her girlfriend with plenty of fluids, enough where Sam herself would be running to the bathroom every fifteen minutes. Alas, despite the very prominent bulge right above her waistline, Rose didn’t even glance towards the bathrooms all day. It would be another day before she’d use one.

See, Sam had quite a thing for desperation, and was very intrigued at her older girlfriend’s ability to hold seemingly forever. She never saw Rose scrambling for a toilet, and always maintained her calm, collected demeanor.

Naturally, one day Rose asked about why she seemed so interested in her bathroom habits. Sam tried to come up with an excuse, but the older woman saw through the lies. “We’re dating and living together, I’m going to find out sooner or later, love. Just say it.”

“Fine...I may or may not have a piss kink,” Sam finally admitted, blushing madly. “It’s such a huge turn on knowing that you can go practically days without peeing.”

“I have gone days,” Rose said. “Believe it or not. Despite having a full bladder, I can handle it for quite some time. The longest I’ve ever gone is five days.”

“Five days?! Weren’t you about to piss yourself?”

“I could’ve definitely gone longer, but I was in the shower and decided otherwise.”

And thus, the idea of getting Rose to hold as long as possible was born. For a while they discussed going camping in the woods, since Rose owned a cabin in an absolutely gorgeous forest about five hours from town. There was a catch: it had no bathroom inside. All campers had to use the great outdoors for their bathroom, and the older woman was proud over the fact that she was never one of those people.

“I bet you that you will be by the end of our trip,” Sam quipped.

Rose laughed. “I’ve never had to, and I never will. My bladder can and will wait for as long as I tell it to.”

“Well...what about how long I tell it to? We can go out there for a week or more, and we’ll see how long you can last!”

Rose agreed. A few weeks later, they were arriving at the cabin, with Rose already having a fairly filled bladder: it was Sam’s request, and she wanted her to be at least 90% filled by the time they got there. Meaning, it had already been two days since Rose last used the bathroom.

They got their luggage out of the trunk and hauled everything inside. Sam’s first idea was to hurry to the bathroom, but halfway down the hall it clicked-there wasn’t one!

“If you have to use the potty, you have to do it outside in the wilderness,” Rose chirped. “Don’t forget that, love. It’s the entire reason why you wanted to come out here in the first place.”

“It’s not the only reason,” Sam muttered, shifting from foot to foot. “Can you come outside with me? Pretty please? It’s getting kind of dark.”

“Big baby.” Rose led her outside and around the building, where the younger woman quickly peed over a small bush. “See how inconvenient it is to do this? This is why I just hold it until I get home.”

“Well, we told our bosses that we’ll be out for two weeks,” Sam said once they were back inside. “Think you can manage for fourteen days? You said your longest wasn’t even a full week.”

“And I could’ve waited longer, remember? Don’t think I won’t last.”

And so it began. They went to bed shortly after, exhausted from the travel and the work week. Sam woke up first the next morning, and turned to face her girlfriend sleeping peacefully next to her. She took her time in observing, noticing that nothing really changed in her overall sleeping pattern.

She couldn’t resist feeling Rose’s bladder, though. It had to be sitting heavy at that point, this was day three without a proper bathroom break. Her hand wandered under the sheets, feeling the all too familiar bulge. It astounded her that it was already three days, and there wasn’t a single obvious sign of desperation.

Rose’s bladder was almost solid. While she wasn’t quite as skinny as Sam was, she still had a nearly flat stomach, so whatever bulge that the younger woman felt was genuine. She couldn’t resist: she pushed down.

Nothing.

She expected some stirring, a gasp, anything. Instead, all she received was a snore as Rose turned away to change positions.

Grumbling to herself, it made Sam even more determined to see Rose absolutely lose it.

About an hour passed, and the older woman finally woke up. Sam had gone out to do her business shortly after she was done looking over Rose, and decided to wake her girlfriend up by cooking breakfast and brewing some coffee.

Rose nearly had an addiction to anything caffeinated, especially coffee. Hell, there were times Sam had to remind her to actually drink water. They ate their breakfast: eggs, bacon and strawberries. The older woman also had about three cups of coffee, and was nursing a fourth and fifth one as they watched television together in the living room.

Sam was snuggled against her girlfriend, casually tracing circles with her fingers against Rose’s belly. In reality, it was also partially to feel the growing bulge. It felt even harder than earlier, and even looked bigger. “Intrigued?” Rose said, startling the younger woman.

“I’m just...in awe,” Sam muttered. “I’ve never seen one so big, and someone so calm about it. How are you able to hold so long, anyway?”

Rose went on to explain how in school, she would always study for hours, shoving away anything that wasn’t relevant. She’d force her bladder to wait until she had completed her studies, and by the time she’d sit on the toilet, over eight hours had passed since the first urge.

It continued into college. Being an engineer meant long, exhausting hours of projects, and having almost an exact schedule. There were times where she couldn’t squeeze in a bathroom break, and would hold a lot longer than desired.

Once she landed her job with the aerospace company, she quickly climbed a few ranks before becoming crew lead, meaning that she had to give weekly briefings to her team, and spontaneous meetings would happen on top of planned ones. Even a thirty-second break would slow down overall productive work, so she eluded the bathroom during her shifts entirely.

“That’s why you always have a gusher at night,” Sam said in awe. “You’re always holding!”

“I just never absolutely feel the need to go,” Rose said. "It's not like I ever purposely hold. If anything, I just use the bathroom when I think about it.”

They spent the rest of the day indoors, Sam making sure to give her girlfriend plenty of fluids: plenty of coffee that morning, a few cans of booze throughout the day, and water for overall hydration (and to stave off the possible hangover). Once again, She was impressed watching her take in everything. Didn’t it all need to go somewhere?

That night, they cuddled. Several times Sam woke up to sprint outside, pee as quickly as she could, and haul ass back indoors. Rose didn’t stir until she woke up the next morning, nursing four days’ worth of piss and looking calm as ever.

After breakfast, the pair decided to go out canoeing, as they weren’t too far from a nearby river they often swam in during the summers. In their storage was a two-seated kayak, sitting on top of a trailer. They hitched it to the back of their car and made their way down.

Sam kept stealing looks towards Rose while the latter drove, trying to make note of any changes whatsoever. There was a prominent bulge, but if anything she looked more relaxed than ever. Quietly, she slipped a hand over her stomach. “Curious?” Rose quipped.

“Intrigued, more like,” Sam said back. “It truly amazes me.” She pushed down, and like before nothing came from it.

A short time later, they arrived at the river. It opened down into a lake, roughly half a mile away. There were other families nearby swimming and enjoying their time on the water. “That means you can’t pop a squat if you need to,” Sam laughed.

Rose rolled her eyes. “I won’t be needing that. It’s you I’m worried for. You did use the bathroom before we left the cabin, yes?”

“O-of course I did!”

They got the kayak off of the trailer and into the water, shedding their clothes so that they were clad in bathing suits and shorts, as well as a thick coating of sunscreen. Sam climbed in the front, and Rose pushed her into the water before taking her seat.

The way their kayak was set up, Rose’s legs basically had to straddle Sam’s waist. That meant that she couldn’t close her legs if the need arose, and Sam was looking forward to it.

The pair paddled for the better part of an hour, enjoying the scenery around them. For a while, both girls forgot about Rose’s challenge, and simply just enjoyed time with each other. That is, until they saw the looming clouds in the distance once they came to the lake. It wasn’t too far away, either. “Time to head back,” Sam said. Rose agreed, and they quickly paddled up the river.

Halfway there, the temperature dropped quite a bit, causing a chill to go up Sam’s back. She felt Rose’s legs clench around her and-wait, clench? Stealing a look behind her, for the first time since they got to the cabin Rose wore a look of worry, and seemed to be stressed. “Are you doing okay?”

“Peachy,” Rose shot back. “Let’s just get back, shall we?”

Without another word, the younger woman continued. She heard Rose swearing behind her a couple of times, and felt her legs shifting. Her heart raced: could she finally feel some desperation? Or is it just from the stress of getting back before the storm?

They kept going, and right as they reached the shore it started raining. Quickly getting the kayak back onto the trailer, they climbed inside their car, listening to the rain come down in torrents against the shell.

Rose was trembling, trying to gather herself while sitting behind the wheel. Her hands didn’t quite reach her crotch, but they grabbed the steering wheel to the point where her knuckles turned white. “You okay, love?” Sam asked.

“Peachy,” the older woman squeaked. She fanned her legs in and out, never crossing them. “This is day five, right?”

“Yes,” Sam agreed. “And you’ve drunk quite a bit more than you normally would. I wonder…” Her hand slipped down to Rose’s lower stomach, and she barely had to press to feel the bulge.

“Don’t…” Rose hissed, “Give me a moment…”

Sam chose to ignore that and pushed down, resulting in Rose taking in a sharp breath, clamping her legs together. She shuffled in her seat, squeezing her eyes shut. Her bladder felt swollen and hot under the younger girl’s fingers, and she had to keep herself from pressing even more.

Finally, she relented. Rose took a moment longer to recover, sitting up straight. She relaxed her body and sighed. “That’s the first time that happened,” she laughed. “Congratulations, you’ve got me desperate for a moment.”

“Only for a-”

“Yes. I was a bit worried about the weather catching up to us, and in our rush to get the kayak back on the trailer I was moving around a lot more and faster than I normally would. And to top it off, it started pouring. Imagine shaking a bottle of soda and throwing it around for a half hour.”

“So, you feel fine now?”

Rose nodded. “Absolutely. I’m afraid you’ll have to try a bit harder to get me where you want me.”

With that being said, Rose started the car, making the drive back in the rain. Although she looked back to normal for the most part, Sam took notice of her legs permanently pressed together.

The ride back to the cabin was silent, save for the rain pounding on the windows. Whenever Sam would speak, Rose would respond, if only briefly.

They got back to the cabin, and it was still raining. They made fast work of putting the kayak and trailer in its storage, and clambered inside. Both women were soaked and shivering. "W-Would you like to t-take a shower?" Rose asked.

Sam nodded, kissing her lover on the cheek as she rushed inside the...bathroom? It technically was one, but it only had a functioning tub and shower head. The space where the toilet would’ve been was instead filled with a bigger sink. The pair lost count of how many times that same sink was the reason that they had their makeout sessions in that room.

Not wanting to miss any of Rose’s withering resolve, Sam was in and out of the bathroom in under five minutes. “Your turn,” she said to Rose.

There was a brief pause. It was fleeting, but was never there before and Sam took notice. “I’ll be out in a bit,” the older woman said before retreating to the bathroom.

Sam watched her shadow pouring from under the door, hobbling from foot to foot as the water cut on. Rose practically threw her clothes to the ground, and Sam watched as her girlfriend took an even quicker shower than she did. Was the water getting to her that much now?

The older woman came out of the room, looking just a tad disheveled. The heavy boulder between her legs was protruding without her even trying at this point. After getting dressed, she took a seat next to Sam on the couch, taking in a sharp gasp as she put pressure on her bladder.

“Looks like you’ll need to use your hands soon,” Sam smirked.

“Keep dreaming, love. Rest assured that I won’t be doing that. I can make my bladder wait as long as I tell it to.”

Or so she thought.

Although it seemingly took forever for Rose to finally show signs of needing to release, once she crossed that threshold everything following happened in rapid succession compared to before. Throughout the course of the night, she went from almost relaxed to sitting stiffly, perched on her heel while her hands fiddled with anything nearby: the remote, a pillow, and then eventually her girlfriend’s hand.

That night, neither really slept that well. Rose kept tossing and turning, while Sam couldn’t help but force herself awake to watch her girlfriend unravel. By morning, Rose was visibly shaking.

It rained for the next two days, so the pair stayed inside. The longer time went on, the more it was evident that the possibility of Rose actually squatting over a bush while still at the cabin was within reach. The older woman swore that she wouldn’t, however.

Every time Sam went outside to pee, she dragged Rose along with her to hold the umbrella. The first couple of times she kept her composure, but the last half had her averting her attention to anything that wasn’t her girlfriend relieving herself mere feet away. The younger girl caught her almost, almost holding herself a few times, but at the last second she’d remember and yank them away.

Eight days in, and Rose seemed to be in shambles. She slept just a bit the night before, but Sam woke her up by sitting on her bladder, and the blonde woman was surprised that she didn’t wet herself right then. It did take her a bit to recover, however.

They had to go into town for a little bit to refresh their supplies for the week. Sam agreed to drive, and Rose struggled with the seatbelt. She tried to not use it, but her girlfriend snatched it from her hands and buckled it in for her, savoring the yelp of pain she received.

Driving to the supermarket was tortuous for Rose, who absolutely couldn’t keep still. She kept switching between crossing her legs and bouncing them around, while her hands were gripping at her thighs. The seatbelt was digging into her bladder, and she was struggling with every single bump that the car hit. At one point she reached to unclasp it, but with a burning glare from her girlfriend she kept it on.

They got to the store, and Sam watched as Rose curled into herself. “Please don’t make me go in there,” she begged. “The idea of walking around right now isn’t pleasant.”

“Afraid you’ll dart off to the bathroom?” the younger blonde teased. “What happened to being able to tell your bladder to hold it as long as it needs to? Sounds like it bested you after all.”

Just like that, there was a reignited fire in Rose’s eyes. Taking a few seconds to breathe, she sat up straight, radiating confidence all over again. She suppressed a hiss as the seatbelt relinquished its hold over her bladder, and practically fell out of the car. Sam followed suit, her own eyes glued to her girlfriend’s body.

They made it inside, and Rose grabbed a shopping cart. “You usually insist that I have the cart because you can never navigate an aisle in one direction,” Sam laughed.

“I’ll let you lead the way this time, love,” Rose said. “After you.”

Sam saw her gripping the cart as tightly as she did the steering wheel, but said nothing of it.

Usually, their shopping endeavours could take up to two hours, even longer when they didn’t have a shopping list. Rose had a bad habit of always deciding to pick up things that they didn’t need right as they were ready to check out, so they’d make the trek back to the other side, make their way to the front again, want something else, rinse, repeat.

This time, however, Rose didn’t pipe up even once. Granted, their checklist was quite smaller compared to the one they would have back at home (because they wanted to have to take back as little as possible, so they promised each other to only get what was necessary), and they had the majority of the items on said list within twenty minutes. “Ready to head back?” Sam asked.

When she didn’t get a response, she looked behind her. Rose was standing completely still, looking like a deer caught in highlights. She had one hand on the cart still, and the other dangerously close to holding herself. Sam pretended to not notice, and repeated her question.

The darker haired woman stayed that way for a solid moment, and Sam truly thought that the moment she would move, a huge gusher would get everywhere. Eventually, Rose took a pained step forward, and then another.

They got in line, and Sam made it a point to choose one right next to the bathrooms. Rose kept eyeing it the entire time, glancing back at her girlfriend every so often. She was bouncing in place, trying her hardest to keep still as much as possible while surrounded by bystanders. “Please?” she whispered softly.

Sam only shook her head. “However, I do need to. I think I’ll take advantage of actually having one here.”

Rose’s eyes widened. “You’re lying…”

“Not at all.” Sam gave her a knowing look. “But you can tell yourself to wait, so clearly you don’t need it. Right?”

“R-right,” Rose answered automatically. She seemed to start shaking even more, especially once all of their items were checked out and paid for and they started towards the bathrooms.

Sam made sure to drag Rose in the stall with her, who instantly broke out into the most animated squirming the blonde woman had ever seen her girlfriend do. She was dancing around, pacing in a circle while-and Sam could’ve squealed for joy here-holding herself with both hands. “I can wait, I can wait,” she kept chanting to herself.

“Are you sure about that?” Sam purred, drinking in the sight of her lover on her last legs. “The toilet is right here if you so desperately need it.”

Rose stared long and hard at it, the offer clearly tempting. “But,” Sam continued, “you did say that you could wait as long as needed, and we still have time to spend at the cabin…”

Doubled over, Rose moaned loudly, shaking her head. “I-I don’t...I don’t n-need it,” she gasped.

“You’re practically twisted into a pretzel, I’m sure that you do. But while you decide…” Sam was sitting on the toilet, waiting. In all honesty, her urge to pee wasn’t that bad at all (compared to Rose’s it was like a drop lost in the damn sea). Nonetheless, she had every intention of torturing her girlfriend as much as possible, and this was the perfect opportunity.

“Look at me when I go,” she commanded. Like a moth to a flame, Rose’s eyes were locked onto Sam’s body. The moment she felt them, the younger woman let go of her bladder, sighing in relief as her stream connected with the water underneath. “So much better.”

“I bet,” Rose gritted. She seemed even more contorted, balancing on one leg while the other was wrapped around it.

Once Sam finished, flushed and washed her hands, Rose tried to leave. “We’re not done in here just yet,” the younger woman grinned. “Sit.”

Rose’s eyes widened. “But I’m not-”

“-Not going, correct,” Sam said. “I want you to sit there for five minutes. And then we’ll head back to the cabin, scout’s honor.”

“You want me to…” Rose took a deep breath, uncoiling her legs from each other. “Very well. I can do this.” She sat down, and instantly went back to squirming.

“Keep your legs open, and no hands,” Sam ordered. Rose whimpered, but listened. Instead, her legs jiggled up and down, and her hands clutched at her thighs and shirt.

Sam took immense joy in this. She never thought she’d see the day where her girlfriend was begging her to let her pee, let alone actually watching her squirm. Thinking back on it, Rose had literal gallons of liquids in her bladder at that point, and it was showing. Hell, even a random woman had congratulated her on being “pregnant” while they were shopping, and Rose awkwardly thanked her while trying to hide the fact that she was pregnant, with piss that is.

As much fun as she was having, a promise was a promise, and they had somewhere to be before the groceries spoiled. “Let’s go, love,” Sam said.

Rose wasted no time getting up, the sudden movement jolting her bladder. Her hands flew to her crotch yet again, and she hurried to the door. “You really want the people out there to see you like this?” Sam laughed.

“People that I will literally never see again,” Rose snapped. “It’s either this or I wet myself-” She paled, realizing the words she said.

Sam noticed, and the biggest smirk spread across her face. “Ah, at the point of no return now? You’re at the possibility of wetting yourself?”

Rose vigorously shook her head. “Of course not! I-I was just talking, the words just slipped out. I can...I can…”

“Tell your bladder to wait?” Sam finished for her. “Well, come on then. Let’s head back, shall we?”

They walked out, ignoring the couple of stares Rose got as she hobbled out of the bathroom. She was firmly holding herself, and staggering behind Sam as they got to their car. The groceries got put away, and they got inside.

Sam put her seatbelt on, but Rose didn’t even make an attempt this time. “Put it on or I’m not leaving.”

“It’s ten fucking minutes, please!” Rose cried.

“Afraid you’d wet the seat if you did?” Sam teased. “You’re not that close to losing complete control, are you? I thought the woman who told me several times that she’s waited for days on end-and only went because why not-could hold it just a tad longer, right?”

“I…” For the first time since her hold started, Rose had nothing to say. She seemed to be torn between wanting to tap out of the bet and pushing herself to her limits, and looked to her girlfriend instead. As if she wanted her to decide for her.

“A bet’s a bet,” Sam laughed. Reaching around Rose, she grabbed her belt, clicking it in place. The darker haired woman groaned in pain, breathing heavily.

As Sam drove, Rose seemed to notice the bumps even more than last time, whining and squirming more with every passing second. The younger woman decided to feel her lover’s bladder for the first time, and with the lightest of touches Rose screamed, gargled words tumbling from her mouth as she attempted to pull away from the offending hand. “Please!” she rasped.

As much as she wanted to push, Sam also didn’t want to risk the possibility of cleaning an impossible amount of fluids from the cushion either. Besides, they were pulling up to the cabin anyway.

The moment the car was parked, Rose hopped out of the car, rushing to the front door. “At least give me a hand with the groceries,” Sam said, rolling her eyes. Thankfully it was only a couple of bags, one of which she handed to her girlfriend.

Once inside, the items were quickly put away, and Sam had all of her attention on the squirmy, fidgeting, clearly at her wits’ end girlfriend. Whatever resolve Rose had left was shattering rapidly, and she was reduced to a blubbering mess of her normal self. “You doing okay?”

“Never better,” Rose moaned. “Doing just fine, definitely holding on to over a week’s worth of piss with minimal problems.”

“Eight days, to be exact,” Sam reminded. “Don’t forget that we got here with your bladder already achingly full.”

“How could I forget? It’s not like you had me chugging water every hour by the end of it.”

“Which reminds me.” There was a half-empty bottle of water on the table in front of the couch, and Sam motioned to it. “Drink it. You’re still holding, aren’t you?”

With great reluctance, Rose grabbed the battle, and chugged it. She tossed the bottle to the side and went back to squirming desperately.

The minutes seemed to drag on as Sam watched Rose pace around the room, whimpering every so often. And just think, she was convinced that she’d never get to this point, she laughed to herself. Of course, I just had to prove her wrong. And prove her wrong, I did.

Sam was pulled from her thoughts as a loud moan ripped through the room, and her attention was averted back to her girlfriend. Rose was holding herself tightly, legs crossed three times over. Her shirt was drenched in sweat, as if her body was so full it was releasing its fluids elsewhere. “I...I-I can’t…” she whispered.

“Hm?” Sam said, her curiosity piqued. “What was that, love?”

“I…” The words seemed to fall off of her tongue, but her actions were loud and clear: she had mere moments before she would release her bladder, whether she told herself to or her body did. “I-I need…”

“Need what, sweetheart? Speak up, I can’t hear you.”

Suddenly, Rose stilled. No squirming, shaking, anything. The only telltale sign of any emotion was the sheer look of hysteria in her eyes. Then, without no warning, she raced outside. Sam barely had time to think and followed closely behind.

Rose went around the cabin, into the very familiar shrubbery that Sam squatted over a dozen times since they arrived. The taller woman grabbed her pants, almost tearing them off as she squatted down. The moment the fabric was moved out of the way, a thick, foamy stream poured from her lips, sputtering against the ground with a force that could rival a rainstorm.

Sam couldn’t believe it, Rose lost! She was pissing at the cabin, the one place she swore she’d never go. “Looks like someone couldn’t hold it,” she mocked.

Rose didn’t even acknowledge the taunt, sighing in relief as the fluids from her body kept coming, seemingly never ending. The force was just as strong as ever, and the puddle around her was growing rapidly.

After two minutes of peeing, Rose finally managed to speak. “You know that you had me drink about a month’s worth of water and caffeine in less than a week, right?” she said. “I could’ve lasted so much longer if I wasn’t drinking so much.”

“Still lasted a lot longer than I expected,” Sam admitted. “You did so good, love. And yes, it was incredibly hot.”

“Excuse me while I finish, I don’t think my bladder is even half empty yet.” Sure enough, it took another five minutes just for the stream to die down, and another two for it to finally taper off. She stood up, shivering from the relief. “Good God...is my puddle really that big?”

The ground absorbed the majority of it by that point, but the ground was visibly wet, and quite a few feet in diameter. “Either way, I can assure you that I’m impressed,” Sam said. “Did you enjoy it?”

“I think I’m starting to see the appeal,” Rose grinned, pressing a kiss to the younger woman’s temple. “I would be more than happy to do this again.”

“Hmm...how about right now?”

Eh, maybe? This one was also a commission, where he wanted extreme, prolonged holding with no sex involved. I'll admit it was a bit out of my realm, but I did have fun!
