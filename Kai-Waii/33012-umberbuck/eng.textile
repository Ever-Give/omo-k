Chapter One: A budding lief (Part one)

###

It was a nice, calm day in may, A doe laid in the tall grass by a lake, with her newborn fawn.

The buck who was the father was protecting her for the small amount of time he would be left with them, The buck leaned down and gently nudged the newborn fawn, Causing him to look up at his mother and father

The fawn looked healthy, it's eyes sparking, The spots on his coat was just the right brightness, The only thing off was...a bright, glowing sigil on the fawn's forehead

The doe gently groomed the fawn, trying to clean off the sigil, But it remained

The doe looked down at the fawn, then up to the buck, The buck closed it's eyes and nodded, then began his trek back to his herd

The doe stood up, the little fawn shakily stood up as well and looked up to its mother

The mother looked down at its fawn, staring at it for a second, before she started walking to her herd

The small fawn followed closely, Almost clinging to its mother's leg

...

His name was.....My name is Lief, I was a young fawn, i only ever saw my father once, and that was when i was very very young

I've lived my whole life with my mom, My sister and 2 of my aunts

When i turned 15 moons old, something happened to me and my sister, our fur started to fall out

I did not know what was happening, my mom feared we were sick,

My sister had a sigil on her forehead like i did, so i wonder if that had something to do with it.

The thing on our foreheads glowed brightly, very brightly, Because of it, We've been nearly caught by predators and the furless, who were tall, large, and (of course) furless creatures who often came with sticks that could kill us from a distance, I lost one of my aunts to them

They've killed so many of us, we've gone into hiding because of them, we stayed in our little area by the lake

I laid down on the forest floor, hunks of fur flaked off of me as i flopped onto the ground, I noticed my front legs have shortened a little bit, it was a little difficult to stand up and walk now because of it

The remaining fur clinging onto me feels heavy, After a while of me resting, My sister wandered over to me, She gently nuzzled me, trying to comfort me

She probably thinks that we're dying and wanted to say bye, I gently nuzzle back, Letting her know i'm ok and that we will be ok

I'm just tired, And my legs hurt, My eyes flutter closed as i fall asleep

...

....

I woke up alone, It was dark, and quiet, nighttime, probably, It was starting to rain.

My forehead no longer burned, Though it was still sore

I stood up, A ring of fallen fur surrounded me, I shivered....it's cold

My legs were terribly unbalanced, my front legs were quite a few inches shorter then my back legs

I had no more fur and my muzzle was almost not there, I gently tried to touch my muzzle with my hoof...

Hoof....it's not a hoof

Out of panic, i lifted up the other front leg to look at my hooves, But i didn't fall over.

I looked at my hoof, It looked really weird, there were these....nubs, on them, I could move them for some reason

I looked down in horror at my... god, i don't even know what they're called, I shakily put them back down on the ground and stood up, Legs...are my front legs even legs anymore?, anyway, legs still uneven

I called for my mom and sister, Letting out a loud bleat that sounded very odd, Mainly because i no longer have a muzzle, I bleated loudly and fearfully, I didn't hear a response, I bleated again fearfully

I started to run, tripping over my shorter front legs, I continued to run, Tears dripping down my face as i ran and ran, Bleating loudly for my herd, I yelled for my mom, my sister and my aunts

I ran and ran, and ran.....and ran, I eventually reached the river, I collapsed in the shallow river, Still bleating loudly before i tried to stand back up

...

I heard a sound that chilled me to the bone, It was almost like a very, very large insect zipping by

I stood there for what felt like many moons before i snapped out of it, i looked around slowly to look for the source of the noise, I see 4 furless roaming in the grass, One was lugging a heavy looking cage, They were yelling to each other, calling them over, One ran off but the other 3 started to walk over

I tried to crawl away, slipping a lot on the smooth river rocks, I tried my best to climb away as quick as i could

I tried to run as fast as i could, Slipping a lot in the river, I hear the furless running after me, I was hit by the rushing water of the river as a beaver dam from up ahead burst, I whimpered as it hit me, it started to push my downstream

Though before it could wash me away, One of the furless grabbed my leg and pulled me out of the water, I bleated as loud as i can and i fought, and fought, I kicked and bit and scratched everyone who came near me, One of the furless took something from one of their bags

It felt like an insect stung me, i didn't see what the furless took out of its bag but i think it's what stung me, I fought harder, trying to escape, then i started feeling tired, one of the other furless gently pat my head, trying to calm me down, I fought the very hardest i ever could, but then, my legs started to feel heavy

My head drooped slightly, as i fought as hard as my limbs could let me, i slammed my head into the furless closest to me as i tried to fight as much as i can, i weakly kicked one of the furless before i went limp, Before i slipped into unconsciousness, I felt the furless slip me into a cage.

((Yes i know there's no omo in this first part but it is being planned, i promise! there's gonna be some in the next part, even!))

((Also i did a bunch of research for this, the breed of the deer that Lief is...er...started out as, is based off of White Tailed deer, however the breed of deer he is was made up (they're called "Umberbucks") ))

((Anywho i hope you guys look forward to the next part of the story, however i am currently moving so i won't be getting a lot of writing done for a while <D ))
