Hello lovely folks! I've posted a couple of works to The Archive featuring Edelgard and her beloved Professor Byleth (girl-Byleth for now). Figured I would post the link here in case anyone is interested!

One is just cute Edie wetting in front of Byleth. The other one is more explicit

Probably more to come, I've got the Edeleth brainworms.

Hope you enjoy~

It's okay to upload the stories here as well. No need to simply drop a link and run.

That said, I quite enjoyed these stories. Looking forward to whatever else you make!

Oh hi! You wrote the Bernadetta story right? I liked that one! Bernie is adorable

I'm really glad you enjoyed these! Maybe I'll crosspost stories here too next time
