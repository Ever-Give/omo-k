After nearly two hours of fitting and tailoring the dress, she looks in the mirror. She looks herself up and down. A long white gown, with silk and lace. She can barely breathe with how tight her corset is, but her soft, thick figure looks astounding. She feels stunning.

“Your Highness, are you satisfied with the dress?” A seamstress asks.

“Yes, it’s mesmerizing. I’m ready to marry my prince tomorrow.” The princess’ soft round face was beaming with happiness. She’s been waiting for this moment for years.

It’s been a long year of courting with the prince. All of the traditions and rules have been followed. Almost. The rules forbid the prince and princess to be alone before the wedding. They always have chaperones with them for their dates, but they’ve made the best of it and fell in love with each other anyway. Luckily, they both have very loyal best friends, and have been able to sneak love letters to each other through them. Princess describes how much she loves the way he teaches her about new things and makes her eager to discover life with him. He makes her feel just like a woman he loves, not just the other royal he was supposed to marry. The chemistry between them is sweet and true, and she knows they are truly meant to be.

The prince tells the princess what a beautiful person she is, inside and out. He says her heart is pure, and that is exactly what an empire needs in order to be successful and strong. He truly adores everything about her, especially her laugh and the way she always twirls her hair, even though she often gets scolded for it being improper by the higher-ups. Tonight, in his final letter before they’re married, he tells her how excited he is to be with her “til death do us part.” He cannot wait to finally kiss his stunning wife’s plump pink lips, and become one union together through their pure naked bodies.

Princess’s heart skipped several beats and her cheeks burned bright red. Heat flushed through her body, and she couldn’t help but giggle to herself in her bedroom. Her mother knocks on her door.

“May I come in?” She asks, as she comes in anyway.

Princess scrambles to hide her steamy letter from Prince underneath her pillow as she sits down on the bed. Her mother sits down beside her.

“Tomorrow night after the ceremony and party, you’ll be able to be alone with your husband. Your room will be prepared with fresh sheets, food, wine, fire, and robes. You and your husband will undress, and unite in bed. You are going to feel different, and nervous, but trust that your husband will make you feel loved, and he will make your body feel pleasure. The rest is up to husband and wife. You will not be disturbed by anyone.” The mother and daughter hug, and the princess goes to bed alone for the last time.

It’s the morning of the wedding, and the princess is awoken by the sound of birds chirping, and busy-ness outside in the courtyard due to wedding preparations. On a normal day, she would be awoken by a servant with breakfast and her dress for that day. However, everyone is wrapped up in the wedding duties, and the princess gets some rare time to herself to relax before the ceremony. The sun is shining into the window onto her bed, and it feels soothing on her skin. She decides to take off her sleep gown to let the heat from the sun rays warm her naked body. She lies facing the window with her legs stretched open and flat on the bed. She sighs with relief that she gets to lay in bed naked with no one bothering her.

It’s much later than the princess’ usual wake time, and she hasn’t had her morning pee yet. She rubs her belly realizing how full her bladder is, but she’s really enjoying laying in the sun, so she slides her hand down to her warm pussy to keep herself from pissing. With her other hand, she examines her soft tits and pink nipples, and she hopes the prince finds her body attractive. She wonders how he’s going to touch her, and what it’s going to feel like. She knows it’s supposed to be pleasurable, but in what way? A warm bath always makes her feel good and relaxed, so she hopes it will be like that.

As she thinks about a lovely bath, a sudden warm urge to piss emerges between her legs and she shivers and her nipples become hard.

“Oof, I need to fucking piss!” She groaned. She quickly sat up from her bed, embraced the warm sun on her naked body for one last moment, and stood up. Gravity almost makes her lose control of her bladder, but she grabs her crotch again and hobbles over to the corner where the ceramic chamber pot is. She positions it for herself and pulls the privacy curtain closed. As she closes the curtain, the morning servant with long hair and a slim body quietly opens the door to her bedroom, prepared to leave her tray of breakfast, and retrieve the used chamber pot, not realizing she woke up later than usual.

Princess doesn’t realize someone is in the room right on the other side of the curtain. She’s so desperate to piss and quickly squats above the chamber pot, beginning to loudly release her hissing piss before she is in the right position. The first few dribbles splashed onto the floor and down the side of the chamber pot. She gasped and clenched her pussy hard, momentarily stopping her stream.

As she relaxes her muscles, her piss starts shooting out with such force into the ceramic bowl, Princess shivers again, and moans with relief. The servant is startled by the sound of her pissing and moaning, but he sets down the tray of food on the table, and stays in the room to observe her finish. 

As the Princess’s loud stream continued, suddenly a loud, echoed toot expelled from her ass, and a few seconds later another toot, this time a little louder. She is embarrassed by her own sounds, so she clenches again, stopping her stream. But she remembers she is actually alone with privacy for once, and she lets herself relax completely, peeing for another thirty seconds.

As her stream becomes weaker, the servant realizes she is about to finish her business any moment, so he quietly sneaks back out of the room. The princess takes a deep breath and stands up, the last couple drops of piss drip out of her onto the floor. She pulls the curtain back, and sees the tray of food on the table. She freezes.

“Someone came in here while I was….” Her eyes began to water with embarrassment, and she covered her face with her hands in humiliation. She quickly runs to grab her robe, and as she gets it on, her maiden comes into the bedroom.

“Princess, your bath is being drawn right now. Eat your breakfast because you’ll be too busy to eat until after the ceremony, and we don’t want you in an unpleasant mood with all of the responsibilities.”

Princess sighs, shrugs off her momentary embarrassment, and sits down to eat her meal. As she eats and drinks water, the maiden is going on about the preparations, the schedule, and everything the princess doesn’t care about. Butterflies begin to flutter in her stomach when she thinks about kissing the prince, and how they’ll get to do that everyday, forever. They’ll get to wake up, eat breakfast, drink wine, and rule the empire together.

The princess finished her meal, and her bath was ready for her. She removes her robe and steps into the steamy hot water. She lies her head back onto the towels folded on the ledge. She takes a deep breath and relaxes her body submerged in the hot water. She props her legs up on the ledges of the tub, closes her eyes, and dozes off. She begins to dream about her gorgeous prince, and the strong, fit body she was soon going to experience. 

The heat of the water relaxes all of the muscles in her body, and suddenly a spurt of piss comes out of her pussy into the bath water, followed by a small tornado of bubbles created by her round, peach, thick ass. This causes a rush of pleasure through her body, and her heat begins to beat faster and faster. A soft, whimpering moan slips from her mouth, causing her to wake up to realize she’s pissing in the bath. She allows herself to keep pissing because she knows once she gets dressed for the wedding, she won’t be able to piss again until she undresses with the prince that night.

Out of curiosity, she places her hand over her pussy to feel the piss stream coming out of her, and starts to slide her fingers up and down. Her pussy begins to throb, and she gasps, startled at how sensitive it feels. She stops touching herself and finishes pissing, then stands up and wraps a towel around her wet body. She dries off, and reluctantly informs her maiden that she is ready to put on her wedding gown.

After a grueling few hours of dressing, hair, and other beauty practices, the princess is finally ready to walk down the aisle to marry her prince. The maiden hands Princess her elegant bouquet of white peonies, and adjusts her veil to sit perfectly along her long, curled, dark hair. Princess walks to the mirror to observe herself and puts on some cherry red lipstick, for the last time before she’s married. Her maiden comes up behind her to tighten the princess’s corset, and as the princess tries to take a breath, she can feel the corset putting pressure onto her bladder. She knew this was going to happen, but it was already too late now. She was about to walk down the aisle, she had no time to pay attention to her bladder.

A very arousing imagination that she is already needing to pee, but she will not get a chance to go for hours.
