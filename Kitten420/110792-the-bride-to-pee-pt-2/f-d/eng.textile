It’s time. The princess stands on her mark, holding her bouquet of peonies tightly. She can hear it get silent on the other side of the curtain, and then the music begins to play for her to walk down the aisle. The curtains open and all eyes are on her. She smiles shyly as she looks around before she starts to walk. She looks at her soon-to-be-husband, and can’t help but tear up a little bit.

The prince gazes at his ravishing bride, and thinks about how they’ve been together their whole lives, and now they get to be together forever. He remembers chasing her while their dogs chased them around the grass and trees everyday. He remembers attending school together, and how she was too shy to ask the professors if she could relieve herself, so he would have to ask for her. She would feel scared having to walk outside to the chamber pot room, so the prince would walk with her. It was always a long walk, and she would be extremely desperate on the way. It was so adorable how she would walk with her hand between her legs, and when she was finally able to pee, her stream was always so loud and forceful. When she would finish, the prince and princess would race each other back to their class.

The princess bride clutches her bouquet and begins to walk down the aisle to her groom. She shines so brightly that everyone in the room is fully captivated by her charm. She stood alongside the prince, her groom. The clergyman has them join hands as they repeat their wedding vows to each other.

"I promise to love you, not just in this life, but in the next, and the next, until we are one with the eternal darkness."

The bride and groom smile and look each other in the eyes.

“I do.” They both promise to each other. The couple share their first official kiss as husband and wife.

“Perfect, let the festivities begin!” The clergyman announces.

The couple enters the party, hand in hand. The music is loud, and everyone is drinking copious amounts of alcohol and dancing. It is time for the couple’s celebratory drink. Everyone looks in their direction. With their arms crossed and intertwined, the couple both finish their drinks in front of the guests. Princess wasn’t used to chugging down spirits like that. Her eyes squinted, and her nose wrinkled as she felt the burning in her mouth and throat. The prince noticed her struggle.

“Are you all right?” He asked while chuckling.

The drink traveled through the princess quickly, because she could feel her bladder shift every time she moved. A sudden twinge of desperation sneaks up on her. She takes a deep breath in an effort to compose herself.

“I’m fine, the spirit was a bit strong.” She gulped and exhaled another loud breath, behavior that the prince has witnessed in her before.

“Is that all, my love?” He asked, knowing she was definitely getting into an urgent situation.

Before she could answer, they heard someone shout that it was time for the wedding cake! A beautifully decorated three-tier cake was being carried straight to the bride and groom’s table. Princess squeezes her legs together anxiously as she watches her cake come to her. The servant sets the cake on the table, too ashamed to look the princess in the face after his unintentional invasion of privacy earlier in the morning. The wedding guests begin to cheer for the newlyweds. The princess takes a deep breath, and holds it in as the prince picks up the cake knife. He gently grabs her hand so that they can cut the first slice, but he notices her momentarily holding her breath, and trying to smile to not give her situation away. But the prince knew her predicament, he can always tell.

The first slice is cut, and the couple feed each other their first bite. It’s not the most moist cake the princess has ever had, and she must wash it down with another sip of ale. She nervously swallows and looks at the prince with big doe eyes. The guests are lining up to offer their best wishes to the newlyweds. As the couple is thanking the guests one by one, the princess grabs the prince’s hand and subconsciously squeezes it every time she feels an aching wave of fullness growing in her bladder. The prince was becoming anxious for her, not wanting her to experience a humiliating accident on the most important day of her life.

However, he couldn’t help but become more eager and excited for their private activities after the reception party was over. He feels his cock throb as he thinks about how his princess’ perfect flower must feel being filled with warm nectar. It’s his job, as a husband, to bring his wife the most sensuous experience of her life. To worship her mind, body, and soul in a way that no one else will ever have the divine opportunity to do.

“Cheers, my good friend!” A deep voice exclaimed, and startled the prince away from his lavish daydream. The tall bearded man wrapped his arm around the prince’s shoulder to guide him away from his new bride.

“You’re supposed to be celebrating, why aren’t you drunk? It’s time to get you drunk, my friend!” Rowdy cheering from men erupts as the prince is handed a large glass and a barrel of beer is revealed. He’s supposed to chug down as much beer as possible, it’s the tradition. He and his mate chug down three jugs of beer.

“You’re still standing! I think you can handle one more!” The prince obliges to his friend’s offer, and chugs down one more beer. He suddenly feels himself stumble backwards, and almost falls on his ass. The alcohol has definitely hit him, and the tradition has now been kept. The prince looks over to his friend finishing the last drops of his own drink.

“Walk with me, brother. Let’s sit in the garden.” The two men drunkenly walk to the garden and sit down on a bench together. The prince felt the alcohol hit his bladder, all at once, and he was suddenly somewhat eager for a piss. It made him remember the princess’ condition when he last saw her about an hour earlier. She had already been pretty desperate after that first drink. The prince is hopeful that she isn’t as desperate as he is at this moment.

The princess had been wandering around the party making pleasantries with the other women. She has been holding the same glass of wine for at least an hour, because she won’t dare drink anymore. The only reason she is being so chatty is to distract herself from her physical discomfort by walking and shuffling her legs as much as possible. All she had to do was look busy. As she was heading toward the stairwell, she noticed her best maiden. Her eyes opened wide, and she smiled largely and with ease. The princess gets her maiden’s attention and she leads her behind a pillar alongside the stairs.

“Aren’t you having a wonderful time, Princess?” The maiden inoffensively asks.

“Yes, everything is quite lovely, thank you, actually, I wanted to thank you for everything, but-“ The Princess was stuttering.

“Relax, you’re welcome! I’m so pleased that I could help make your day a beautiful memory!” The maiden interrupted.

The princess was becoming less at ease every second, and she was beginning to feel ashamed to admit her predicament to her friend. The maiden had no clue that the princess was in such an urgent and dire situation. Another wave of desperation startles the princess, and she can feel her legs tremble as her brimming bladder spasms. She huffs as the twinge is becoming too much for the poor bride to bear. She grabs the maiden’s hand, and looks her frantically in the eyes.

“I need to go upstairs to my room! Right now!” The princess pleaded.

“Right now? You must wait for your husband!” Her maiden exclaimed. As the two are speaking, there is a loud disturbance in the yard. Princess momentarily forgets her aching condition as her friend begins complaining.

“Those foolish drunk men must be fighting! I’ll meet you at the balcony in a few minutes!” She yells as she runs towards the commotion.

Princess lets out a desperate, frustrated groan as she sharply heads up the stairwell to the balcony overlooking the garden. She placed her hands firmly on the ledge of the railing, took a deep breath, and noticed the prince in the garden with his best mate. The two men couldn’t see the princess from their position, but she had a perfect view of the two of them. She couldn’t hear exactly what they were saying, but she could tell they were drunk and rowdy. She suddenly became bashful as she gazed at her prince. What the maiden said was true, she wasn’t supposed to go to their bedroom without her husband, it’s their wedding night! The princess blushed and wondered why her maiden was taking so long to return.

The prince and his friend were becoming drunker by the moment as their bloodstream was still absorbing the copious amount of beer they drank.

“To be quite honest with you brother, I don’t think I have ever needed to take a piss so badly in my life.” The prince awkwardly stated, as he fumbled to stand up.

“You bastard! Me too! I nearly pissed myself during my final jug!” The friends jeered at each other as they stood up.

“I bet I can piss farther than you can!” The mischievous drunk friend suggested.

“Is that a real challenge, you crazy fool?! I bet you’re wrong.” The prince responded while he lifted his top preparing to pull his shaft out to piss competitively with his friend. The two comrades stand side-by-side and pull their cocks out of their pants. The prince was serious about how badly he needed to piss, because he barely got his cock out before he started letting loose. His mate took a bit longer to release his stream, but it was mere seconds before they were tied with how far their piss puddles were landing.

The princess doesn’t realize what they’re doing yet. She moves to a spot where she could see the men more clearly. With the shift of light, she was finally able to see their jets of piss splashing into the dirt. The prince had his legs spread slightly, pants around his knees, and one hand holding his cock. He rested his other hand on his hip, and he tilted his head back and sighed in ecstasy. As he sighed, his flow started surging out more powerfully, creating a double stream. Without even looking, the prince turned to his friend with a satisfied smirk on his face. His mate attempted to piss farther, and drunkenly positioned himself nearly sideways, only causing both streams of piss to cross.

Princess has never witnessed anything so raunchy and vulgar before. She knew she should feel embarrassed and repulsed, but seeing the prince piss so forcefully, she couldn’t help but enjoy what she was witnessing. She wonders what it’s like to hold a dick while piss is gushing out of it. She wonders what exactly it’s going to look like, this is the most she has ever seen of the prince’s body before. Suddenly the princess feels a hot gush escape from her pussy into her panties. She snaps out of her fantasy, and quickly tries to regain control of her bursting bladder.

The princess tries to get herself into a squatting position, but her tight corset prevents her from doing so. She is slightly hunched over, hands trying to grasp at her crotch, but her gown is too thick. She feels another strong spurt leak out of her pussy and begins to panic. The princess was nearly about to have a piss accident in her wedding gown and she has no idea how much longer her maiden is going to take. She uses every bit of strength she has to clench her pelvic muscles and stop the piss from escaping from her pulsing pussy.
