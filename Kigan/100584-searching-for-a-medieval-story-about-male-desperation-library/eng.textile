Some longer time ago there was a male desperation story in a medieval setting that I can't find anymore. I don't remember a lot about the plot but there was this man that was given the task to organise an old library but I think the door to his privy was stuck and the queen was all horny about it? If I remember correctly he used magic to seal up his bladder ending in holding his for a month or two. The way it was written was very similar to "The never pee Land" by Pain. Maybe someone else remembers reading the story and can tell me the title or the author?
